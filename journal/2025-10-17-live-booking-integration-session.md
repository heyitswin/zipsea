# 2025-10-17: Live Booking Integration Session - Progress & Blocker

## Session Overview
Continued implementing live booking functionality. Successfully integrated booking session logic into cruise detail page and ran database migrations. Discovered critical blocker with cruise ID format mismatch.

---

## Work Completed ‚úÖ

### 1. Reviewed Traveltek API Documentation Thoroughly
- Studied complete booking flow: search ‚Üí cabin grades ‚Üí specific cabins ‚Üí add to basket ‚Üí book ‚Üí payment
- Understood session management: `sessionkey` and `sid` obtained from cruise search
- Verified API parameter requirements for each endpoint
- Key finding: `codetocruiseid` is the primary identifier for Traveltek cruises

### 2. Cruise Detail Page - Live Booking Integration
**File:** `frontend/app/cruise/[slug]/CruiseDetailClient.tsx`

**Changes Made:**
- Added live booking state management:
  - `isLiveBookable` - checks if cruise is Royal Caribbean (22) or Celebrity (3)
  - `passengerCount` - retrieved from sessionStorage (set by PassengerSelector)
  - `bookingSessionId` - stores session ID after creation
  - `liveCabinGrades` - stores cabin grades/pricing from Traveltek
  - `isLoadingCabins` - loading state for API calls
  - `selectedCabinCategory` - tab state for cabin category selection

- Added passenger data retrieval:
  ```typescript
  useEffect(() => {
    // Check if cruise is live-bookable
    const liveBookingLineIds = [22, 3];
    const isLiveBooking = liveBookingLineIds.includes(Number(cruiseLineId));
    
    // Retrieve passenger count from sessionStorage
    if (isLiveBooking && typeof window !== 'undefined') {
      const storedPassengerCount = sessionStorage.getItem('passengerCount');
      setPassengerCount(JSON.parse(storedPassengerCount));
    }
  }, [cruiseData]);
  ```

- Created booking session function:
  ```typescript
  const createBookingSessionAndFetchCabins = async () => {
    // POST /api/v1/booking/session with cruiseId and passengerCount
    const sessionResponse = await fetch(...);
    setBookingSessionId(sessionData.sessionId);
    
    // GET /api/v1/booking/:sessionId/pricing?cruiseId=xxx
    const pricingResponse = await fetch(...);
    setLiveCabinGrades(pricingData);
  };
  ```

- Auto-fetch cabin grades when cruise loads:
  ```typescript
  useEffect(() => {
    if (isLiveBookable && passengerCount && cruise?.id && !bookingSessionId) {
      createBookingSessionAndFetchCabins();
    }
  }, [isLiveBookable, passengerCount, cruise?.id]);
  ```

**Commits:**
- `93a794a` - Add live booking integration to cruise detail page
- `68cc543` - Add dedicated migration script for booking tables

### 3. Database Migration - Booking Tables Created
**Migration:** `backend/src/db/migrations/0012_add_live_booking_tables.sql`

**Tables Created:**
1. `booking_sessions` - Active booking flows with Traveltek session management
   - Stores: `traveltek_session_key`, `traveltek_sid`, `passenger_count`, `cruise_id`
   - 2-hour TTL matching Traveltek API requirements
   - Status tracking: active, expired, completed, abandoned

2. `bookings` - Completed cruise bookings
   - Stores: `traveltek_booking_id`, `booking_details`, pricing, payment status
   - Foreign keys: user_id, cruise_id, booking_session_id

3. `booking_passengers` - Passenger details for each booking
   - Personal info: name, DOB, gender, citizenship
   - Contact info for lead passenger
   - Address fields

4. `booking_payments` - Payment transactions
   - Tracks deposits and final payments
   - Stores: amount, payment_method, transaction_id, status
   - PCI compliant (only last 4 digits of card stored)

**Migration Script Created:**
- `backend/scripts/run-booking-migration.js`
- Runs migration 0012 specifically
- Includes table verification after completion

**Migration Result:**
```
‚úÖ Booking tables migration completed successfully!

Verifying tables:
  booking_sessions: ‚úÖ Created
  bookings: ‚úÖ Created
  booking_passengers: ‚úÖ Created
  booking_payments: ‚úÖ Created

Booking sessions table: 0 rows

‚úÖ All booking tables are ready for live booking!
```

### 4. Backend API Testing Attempted
Tested booking session creation endpoint:
```bash
curl -X POST https://zipsea-backend.onrender.com/api/v1/booking/session \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "cruiseId": "22-2025-01-05-7-BAR",
    "passengerCount": {"adults": 2, "children": 0, "childAges": []}
  }'
```

**Result:** ‚ùå **Foreign key constraint violation**
```json
{
  "error": "Failed to create booking session",
  "message": "insert or update on table \"booking_sessions\" violates foreign key constraint \"booking_sessions_cruise_id_fkey\""
}
```

## Critical Blocker Discovered üö®

### Issue: Cruise ID Format Mismatch

**Expected (Traveltek):**
- Cruise ID format: `codetocruiseid` (e.g., `"22-2025-01-05-7-BAR"`)
- This is how Traveltek identifies cruises in their API
- Our schema defines `cruises.id` as VARCHAR to store this

**Actual (Production Database):**
- Cruise IDs are numeric: `"2186855"`, `"2186856"`, etc.
- Not the Traveltek `codetocruiseid` format
- Cannot be used directly with Traveltek APIs

**Evidence:**
```json
// Production cruise response
{
  "id": "2186855",  // ‚ùå Numeric, not Traveltek format
  "name": "Western Caribbean from Galveston, TX",
  "cruiseLine": {"name": "Carnival Cruise Line"}
}
```

**Schema Design (from 0012 migration):**
```sql
CREATE TABLE booking_sessions (
  cruise_id VARCHAR(255) REFERENCES cruises(id) NOT NULL,
  -- Expects cruises.id to be Traveltek codetocruiseid
);
```

**Root Cause:**
The production database appears to use an older schema where cruise IDs are auto-incrementing integers, not Traveltek's `codetocruiseid` strings. The FTP sync process may be generating these numeric IDs rather than using Traveltek's identifiers.

---

## Investigation Needed

### 1. Check Database Schema
Need to verify the actual `cruises` table structure:
```sql
SELECT column_name, data_type 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'cruises' 
AND column_name IN ('id', 'traveltek_cruise_id', 'cruise_id');
```

### 2. Check if Traveltek ID is Stored Elsewhere
The schema mentions `traveltekCruiseId` field:
```typescript
// From backend/src/db/schema/cruises.ts
traveltekCruiseId: integer('traveltek_cruise_id').notNull()
```

But this is defined as INTEGER, not VARCHAR for `codetocruiseid`.

### 3. Understand FTP Sync Process
Need to review how cruises are synced from Traveltek FTP:
- What ID is used as primary key?
- Is `codetocruiseid` stored anywhere?
- Is there a mapping table?

---

## Possible Solutions

### Option 1: Add codetocruiseid to Cruises Table
Add new column to store Traveltek's cruise identifier:
```sql
ALTER TABLE cruises ADD COLUMN traveltek_code_to_cruise_id VARCHAR(255);
CREATE INDEX idx_cruises_traveltek_code ON cruises(traveltek_code_to_cruise_id);
```

Then update FTP sync to populate this field from the JSON filename or data.

**Frontend changes needed:**
```typescript
// Use traveltek_code_to_cruise_id instead of id
const sessionResponse = await fetch(..., {
  body: JSON.stringify({
    cruiseId: cruise.traveltekCodeToCruiseId,  // Not cruise.id
    passengerCount
  })
});
```

### Option 2: Create ID Mapping Service
Backend service that:
1. Takes numeric cruise ID from frontend
2. Looks up corresponding Traveltek `codetocruiseid`
3. Uses that for Traveltek API calls

### Option 3: Change Primary Key Strategy
Migrate cruise IDs to use `codetocruiseid` as primary key (major schema change, risky for existing data).

---

## Next Steps (Priority Order)

### Immediate
1. **Investigate production schema** - Determine actual cruise ID structure
2. **Check FTP sync code** - See how cruise IDs are generated
3. **Decide on solution approach** - Based on findings above

### Once ID Mapping Resolved
4. **Test booking session creation** with correct cruise ID
5. **Test cabin grade fetching** from Traveltek API
6. **Continue frontend implementation:**
   - Create tabbed cabin category UI (Interior/Outside/Balcony/Suite)
   - Display live cabin grades with pricing
   - Add "Reserve" buttons to navigate to booking flow
7. **Build booking flow pages:**
   - Options Selection page (`/booking/[sessionId]/options`)
   - Passenger Details page (`/booking/[sessionId]/passengers`)
   - Payment page (`/booking/[sessionId]/payment`)
   - Confirmation page (`/booking/[sessionId]/confirmation`)

## Files Modified This Session

### Frontend
- `frontend/app/cruise/[slug]/CruiseDetailClient.tsx` - Live booking integration

### Backend
- `backend/scripts/run-booking-migration.js` - NEW migration runner

### Database
- All booking tables created via migration 0012

---

## Environment Status

### Staging Backend
- Points to production database (as documented)
- Booking tables created successfully
- Ready for API testing once ID issue resolved

### Production Database
- Booking tables created ‚úÖ
- Cruise ID format issue discovered üö®
- Live booking currently blocked

### Git Status
- All code committed and pushed to main branch
- Ready for staging testing once blocker resolved

---

## Key Learnings

### 1. Traveltek API Design
- Session creation requires cruise search (returns `sessionkey` and `sid`)
- `codetocruiseid` is the primary identifier throughout the API
- All subsequent calls reference the initial session

### 2. Database Foreign Key Constraints
- Proper foreign key setup caught the ID mismatch immediately
- This is good - prevents bad data from entering the system
- But requires solving the ID mapping issue before proceeding

### 3. Schema vs Reality
- Schema documentation said `cruises.id` would be VARCHAR with `codetocruiseid`
- Reality shows numeric IDs in production
- Always verify production schema matches expectations

---

## Questions for Next Session

1. **What is the source of truth for cruise IDs?**
   - FTP filenames contain `codetocruiseid` - should we use those?
   - Or does the JSON data inside have a different ID?

2. **When did the ID format change?**
   - Was this always numeric?
   - Or did a migration change it?

3. **Are there other Traveltek IDs we need?**
   - Ship IDs?
   - Port IDs?
   - Do these also need mapping?

4. **Should we expose Traveltek IDs to frontend?**
   - Or keep mapping logic in backend only?

---

## Technical Debt Created

- Frontend expects to use `cruise.id` directly for booking, but this won't work
- Need to update frontend once ID mapping solution is implemented
- May need to add Traveltek ID fields to cruise API responses

---

## Recommendations

### High Priority
1. Resolve cruise ID mapping issue ASAP (blocks all live booking features)
2. Document the ID mapping strategy for future reference
3. Add Traveltek ID to cruise API responses if needed

### Medium Priority
1. Add error handling for ID lookup failures
2. Consider caching Traveltek session keys (currently re-created each time)
3. Add logging for all Traveltek API calls (debugging)

### Low Priority
1. Create admin tool to view booking sessions
2. Add session cleanup job for expired sessions
3. Monitor Traveltek API rate limits

---
