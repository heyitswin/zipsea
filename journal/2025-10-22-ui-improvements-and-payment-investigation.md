# Session: UI Improvements & Payment Investigation

**Date:** 2025-10-22  
**Status:** In Progress - Partial completion  
**Context:** Testing live booking on staging (pointing to production backend/DB)

---

## Session Overview

This session focused on implementing various UI improvements for the booking flow and investigating payment decline issues with Traveltek API.

---

## Issues Addressed

### ✅ 1. Payment Decline Investigation

**Problem:** Payment failing with `authcode: ''` (empty) and `fraudcategory: 'Yellow'`

**Analysis:**
- Booking is being created successfully (ID: 14404355, 14404274)
- Payment is included in booking call using `ccard` object
- Card: `4147202275904959` being declined by payment processor
- `fraudcategory: 'Yellow'` = medium risk fraud flag
- Empty `authcode` = no payment authorization

**Root Cause:**
The payment decline is **legitimate** - not a code issue:
1. Card may not be a valid test card for Traveltek environment
2. Fraud detection flagging the transaction
3. May need Traveltek-specific test card numbers

**Recommendations:**
- Contact Traveltek support for test card numbers
- Verify if using test mode vs production mode
- Standard test cards (4111111111111111) may not work with Traveltek's processor

**Documentation References:**
- Traveltek docs don't provide test card numbers
- `modified:1` field indicates accessible cabins per docs
- Fraud categories not documented in public API docs

---

## UI Improvements Completed

### ✅ 2. Best Value Banner Color Change

**Change:** Changed banner from purple to green `#1B8F57` with white text

**File:** `frontend/app/cruise/[slug]/CruiseDetailClient.tsx` (line 1565)

**Before:**
```tsx
<div className="... bg-purple-obc text-dark-blue ...">
  Best Value
</div>
```

**After:**
```tsx
<div className="... bg-[#1B8F57] text-white ...">
  Best Value
</div>
```

---

### ✅ 3. Accessible Cabin Icon

**Change:** Added handicap icon (♿) for cabins with `modified:1` field

**Supported Cruise Lines:** Royal Caribbean, Celebrity, Carnival

**Backend Changes:**
**File:** `backend/src/services/traveltek-booking.service.ts`

Added `accessible` field to cabin data:
```typescript
// Line 249 - Cabin grades response
accessible: cabin.modified === 1 || cabin.modified === '1',

// Line 281 - Fallback case
accessible: cabin.modified === 1 || cabin.modified === '1',

// Line 672 - Specific cabins response
accessible: cabin.modified === 1 || cabin.modified === '1',
```

**Frontend Changes:**

1. **SpecificCabinModal** - `frontend/app/components/SpecificCabinModal.tsx`
   - Added `accessible?: boolean` to Cabin interface (line 19)
   - Added icon display (line 298-302):
   ```tsx
   {cabin.accessible && (
     <span className="text-blue-600" title="Accessible cabin">
       ♿
     </span>
   )}
   ```

2. **Cabin Cards** - `frontend/app/cruise/[slug]/CruiseDetailClient.tsx`
   - Added icon display (line 1596-1600):
   ```tsx
   {cabin.accessible && (
     <span className="text-blue-600 text-[16px]" title="Accessible cabin">
       ♿
     </span>
   )}
   ```

---

### ✅ 4. Reserve Cabin Modal Full Screen on Mobile

**Change:** Made HoldBookingModal full screen on mobile, centered modal on desktop

**File:** `frontend/app/components/HoldBookingModal.tsx`

**Pattern:** Matches SpecificCabinModal design

**Before:**
```tsx
<div className="fixed inset-0 bg-black bg-opacity-50 z-50 flex items-center justify-center p-4">
  <div className="bg-white rounded-lg max-w-2xl w-full max-h-[90vh] overflow-y-auto">
```

**After:**
```tsx
<div className="fixed inset-0 z-50 overflow-y-auto">
  {/* Backdrop */}
  <div className="fixed inset-0 bg-black bg-opacity-50 transition-opacity" onClick={handleClose} />
  
  {/* Modal - Full screen on mobile, centered on desktop */}
  <div className="flex min-h-full items-center justify-center md:p-4">
    <div className="relative w-full h-full md:h-auto md:max-w-2xl bg-white md:rounded-lg shadow-xl flex flex-col">
```

**Benefits:**
- Full screen on mobile eliminates need for scrolling in small viewports
- Better mobile UX matching other modals (SpecificCabinModal, filters)
- Desktop remains centered modal

---

### ✅ 5. Cancellation Policy Link (Already Implemented)

**Status:** Verified already working correctly

**File:** `frontend/app/booking/[sessionId]/payment/page.tsx` (line 523-533)

**Implementation:**
- Fetches `cancellationPolicyUrl` from cruise line API
- Displays link if available: "View [Cruise Line]'s Cancellation Policy"
- Shows fallback message if not available
- Opens in new tab with external link icon

---

### ✅ 6. Ship Image in Booking Summary (Already Implemented)

**Status:** Verified already working correctly

**File:** `frontend/app/components/BookingSummary.tsx` (line 175-184)

**Implementation:**
- Fetches ship image from cruise API
- Displays 80x80 thumbnail next to booking details
- Fallback chain for image URLs (HD → 2K → standard)
- Only displays if `cruiseData?.shipImage` exists

---

## Outstanding Tasks

### ⏳ 7. Mobile Input Zoom Prevention

**Issue:** iOS Safari zooms when focusing inputs with font-size < 16px

**Solution:** Ensure all input fields in filters modal have `text-[16px]` class

**Status:** Need to locate filters modal component (not found in current search)

**Note:** May be referring to a different modal or future feature

---

### ⏳ 8. Move Passenger Info to Booking Summary (Step 3)

**Requirement:** 
- Move passenger list from separate box into BookingSummary component
- Change labels from "Lead Passenger" / "Guest 2" to "Adult 1", "Adult 2", "Child 1", etc.

**Current Implementation:**
- Passengers displayed in separate box on payment page
- Labels: "Lead Passenger" and "Guest X"
- File: `frontend/app/booking/[sessionId]/payment/page.tsx` (line 257-289)

**TODO:**
1. Add passenger section to BookingSummary component
2. Determine adult/child based on `passengerType` field
3. Update labels to "Adult 1", "Adult 2", "Child 1"
4. Remove separate passenger box from payment page
5. Ensure passenger data passed to BookingSummary via props

---

### ⏳ 9. Integrate Hold Cabin Flow into 1-2-3 Booking Flow

**Current State:**
- Hold cabin has separate 2-step modal flow
- Hold cabin collects minimal info (name, email, phone)
- Creates placeholder booking without payment

**Requirement:**
- Direct from hold cabin modal to 1-2-3 booking flow
- Skip credit card collection
- Still collect all passenger details, options, etc.
- Remove 2nd state of hold cabin modal

**TODO:**
1. Modify hold cabin button to route directly to `/booking/[sessionId]/options`
2. Add `isHoldBooking` flag to session/booking flow
3. Skip payment step if `isHoldBooking === true`
4. Modify options/passengers pages to handle hold flow
5. Update final confirmation for hold bookings
6. Remove hold confirmation modal (current 2nd step)

**Implementation Notes:**
- Backend already supports hold bookings via `createHoldBooking()` method
- Hold creates placeholder passengers with default data
- Need to replace placeholder data with real passenger details from forms
- Balance due date should be displayed for holds

---

## Files Modified

### Backend
- `backend/src/services/traveltek-booking.service.ts` - Added `accessible` field to cabins

### Frontend
- `frontend/app/cruise/[slug]/CruiseDetailClient.tsx` - Best Value banner color, accessible icon
- `frontend/app/components/SpecificCabinModal.tsx` - Accessible icon
- `frontend/app/components/HoldBookingModal.tsx` - Full screen mobile modal

---

## Testing Notes

### Payment Testing
- User testing with card: `4147202275904959`
- Card being declined by Traveltek payment processor
- Need test cards from Traveltek support

### Deployment Status
- Staging frontend → Production backend/DB (staging DB drifted)
- Backend rebuilt locally (not yet deployed to production)
- Frontend changes not committed (user requested backend-only commits)

---

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Passenger Info Move**
   - Modify BookingSummary component to accept and display passengers
   - Update labels to Adult/Child numbering
   - Remove separate passenger box from payment page

2. **Integrate Hold Cabin Flow**
   - Route hold cabin to options page
   - Add hold booking flag to flow
   - Skip payment for holds
   - Update confirmation pages

3. **Deploy Backend Changes**
   - Build backend: `npm run build` in `/backend`
   - Commit backend changes only (no frontend)
   - Deploy to production via Render

4. **Get Test Cards from Traveltek**
   - Contact Traveltek support for test card numbers
   - Verify test vs production mode settings
   - Confirm fraud category meanings

---

## Important Notes

### Deployment Strategy
- **Staging (main branch):** Safe to commit/push all changes
- **Production:** ONLY commit backend files (not frontend)
- Testing on staging frontend pointing to production backend

### Code Standards
- Never make visual changes without explicit request
- Always refer to Traveltek docs (don't assume)
- Test across multiple cruises/data sources
- Modify existing files primarily
- Long-term solutions only

### Traveltek API Notes
- `modified:1` = accessible cabin (per docs)
- Payment included in booking via `ccard` object
- Separate payment endpoint also available (`/payment.pl`)
- Current implementation uses payment in booking call

## Key Reminders for Next Session

1. **DO NOT commit frontend changes to production** - only backend
2. Backend needs rebuild before production deployment
3. Contact Traveltek for test card numbers before more payment testing
4. Passenger info move requires understanding passengerType field logic
5. Hold cabin integration is major refactor - may need user clarification on flow
