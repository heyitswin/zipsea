# Session: October 24, 2025 - Homepage Redesign & Search Bar Overhaul

**Date:** October 24, 2025  
**Duration:** ~1.5 hours  
**Focus:** Complete homepage redesign per user mockup requirements  
**Branch:** main (staging)  
**Status:** ‚úÖ All changes completed and deployed

---

## Session Summary

This session focused entirely on homepage visual and functional improvements based on user-provided mockup (`zipsea-homepage-updated.png`). The main task was to completely redesign the search bar from 3 separate pill buttons to a single unified pill with integrated fields, along with numerous other refinements.

---

## Context from Previous Session

The previous session (resumed from context) had completed:
- Homepage video mask hero section implementation
- Navigation placement inside video container
- Old search bar restoration from git history with icons
- Initial homepage layout with banners, destinations, and testimonials

However, the user requested significant additional changes to match the mockup more closely.

---

## Tasks Completed

### 1. Navigation & Authentication Updates ‚úÖ

**Hide Primary Navigation on Homepage**
- Added CSS injection via `useEffect` to hide the main `<nav>` element only on homepage (`pathname === "/"`)
- Prevents double navigation (main nav + hero nav)
- CSS is dynamically injected and removed based on route
- Implementation: Added style element with `display: none !important` for nav tag

**Sign In Link Updated**
- Removed direct link to `/sign-in` (Clerk route)
- Implemented `LoginSignupModal` component integration
- Added `isLoginModalOpen` state
- Sign in button now triggers modal: `onClick={() => setIsLoginModalOpen(true)}`
- Modal handles authentication flow without page navigation
- Maintains consistent UX with main navigation's login modal

**Browse Cruises Button Color**
- Changed from `bg-dark-blue` to direct style: `backgroundColor: "#2238C3"`
- Applied to both hero navigation button
- Ensures exact color match with design spec

- Box shadow: `0 0 0 3px rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.3)`

**Field Reordering**

4. **Search Button** (attached) - Circle with search icon, blue bg

**Removed Destinations Dropdown**

- Dropdown UI with +/- buttons for incrementing/decrementing
- Display format: "2 Guests", "1 Guest", etc.
- Separate controls for adults and children

### 3. Date Picker Enhancements ‚úÖ

**Hide Past Months Completely**
- Previously: Past months shown but disabled
- Now: Past months not rendered at all
- Implementation: `if (isPast) return null;` in month button mapping
- Cleaner UI, less visual clutter
- Users only see available future months

**Added 2027 Months**
- Extended year array from `[2025, 2026]` to `[2025, 2026, 2027]`
- All 12 months of 2027 now selectable
- Forward-looking availability for advance bookings

**Improved Dropdown Size**
- Width increased to 450px (from 400px)
- Height increased to 550px max (from 500px)
- Better visibility of month grids across 3 years
- Reduced scrolling needed

---

### 4. Banner Clickability ‚úÖ

**First Time Cruisers Guide Banner**
- Wrapped image in `<a href="https://www.zipsea.com/first-time-cruisers-guide">`
- Added `hover:opacity-95` for visual feedback
- Full URL used (external link with www subdomain)

**Free Gift Banner**
- Wrapped image in `<a href="/cruises">`
- Added `hover:opacity-95` for visual feedback
- Routes to main cruise browse page

**Accessibility**
- Both banners are proper anchor tags
- Semantic HTML for better SEO
- `block` display for full image area clickability

---

### 5. Destination Cards Polish ‚úÖ

**Reduced Hover Effect**
- Previous: `hover:scale-105` (5% scale increase)
- New: `hover:scale-[1.025]` (2.5% scale increase)
- Exactly half the "pop" effect as requested
- More subtle, professional interaction

**Container Padding Fix**
- **Removed:** `pb-6 md:pb-10` from section
- **Why:** Background sand color was extending past the separator
- Section now ends: `<section className="bg-sand pt-12 md:pt-20">`
- Padding moved to inner div: `pb-8 md:pb-12` on button container only
- Separator sits flush against section bottom

---

### 6. Testimonials Section Spacing ‚úÖ

**Reduced Vertical Margins by Half**
- Previous: `py-6 md:py-10`
- New: `py-3 md:py-5`
- Tighter vertical rhythm
- Better visual flow into footer

**Reduced Title Margin**
- Previous: `mb-8 md:mb-12`
- New: `mb-6 md:mb-8`
- Proportional reduction matching section padding

---

## Technical Implementation Details

### Component Structure

```typescript
// State management
const [adults, setAdults] = useState(2);
const [children, setChildren] = useState(0);
const [selectedMonths, setSelectedMonths] = useState<string[]>([]);
const [selectedCruiseLines, setSelectedCruiseLines] = useState<number[]>([]);
const [isLoginModalOpen, setIsLoginModalOpen] = useState(false);

// Dropdown states
const [isGuestsDropdownOpen, setIsGuestsDropdownOpen] = useState(false);
const [isDateDropdownOpen, setIsDateDropdownOpen] = useState(false);
const [isCruiseLineDropdownOpen, setIsCruiseLineDropdownOpen] = useState(false);

// Refs
const guestsDropdownRef = useRef<HTMLDivElement>(null);
const dateDropdownRef = useRef<HTMLDivElement>(null);
const cruiseLineDropdownRef = useRef<HTMLDivElement>(null);
```

### Search Bar Layout

```tsx
<div className="bg-white rounded-full flex items-center">
  {/* Cruise Line - border-r */}
  <div className="relative flex-1 border-r border-gray-200">
    <button className="rounded-l-full">...</button>
  </div>
  
  {/* Dates - border-r */}
  <div className="relative flex-1 border-r border-gray-200">
    <button>...</button>
  </div>
  
  {/* Guests - no border */}
  <div className="relative flex-1">
    <button>...</button>
  </div>
  
  {/* Search Button - circle */}
  <button className="h-[74px] w-[74px] rounded-full" 
          style={{ backgroundColor: "#2238C3" }}>
    <Image src="/images/search.svg" />
  </button>
</div>
```

### Hide Nav Implementation

```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  if (pathname === "/") {
    const style = document.createElement("style");
    style.id = "hide-nav-on-homepage";
    style.innerHTML = `nav { display: none !important; }`;
    document.head.appendChild(style);
    
    return () => {
      const styleEl = document.getElementById("hide-nav-on-homepage");
      if (styleEl) styleEl.remove();
    };
  }
}, [pathname]);
```

## Future Considerations

### Guest Count in Search
Currently, guest count (adults/children) is captured in state but not passed to the search URL. This could be added later:

```typescript
const handleSearchCruises = () => {
  const params = new URLSearchParams();
  
  // Could add:
  params.set("adults", adults.toString());
  if (children > 0) {
    params.set("children", children.toString());
  }
  
  // ... rest of params
};
```

### Mobile Responsiveness
The new unified search bar currently only shows on desktop (`hidden md:block`). A mobile version needs to be designed and implemented:
- Possibly stack fields vertically
- Or use a modal/drawer approach
- Or simplify to fewer fields on mobile

### Guest Age Inputs
If children > 0, might want to collect child ages (similar to live booking flow):
- Show age selectors for each child
- Required for accurate cruise pricing
- Could be added to guests dropdown UI
