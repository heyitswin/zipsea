# Journal Entry: September 3, 2025 - Webhook System Overhaul & Critical Fixes

## Session Overview
Major overhaul of the Traveltek webhook processing system, moving from batch sync with flags to real-time parallel processing with BullMQ. Fixed critical FTP failures, email templates, and admin dashboard issues.

## Critical Issues Discovered & Fixed

### 1. **The 690 Cruise Processing Cap**
**Discovery**: Batch sync was consistently processing exactly 690 cruises every run.

**Root Cause**: 
- Hardcoded limits: 6 ships × 100 files = 600 base + overhead = 690
- Line 63 had 31 ships but only 6 were being processed
- 974 cruises were permanently stuck

**Fix**:
- Increased limits: 6→35 ships, 100→200 files/ship, 2000→6000 files/line
- Now processes ~10x more cruises per sync

### 2. **Webhook Workers Not Initializing** 
**Discovery**: Slack notifications weren't being sent despite Redis/BullMQ working.

**Root Cause**:
- `realtimeWebhookService` was never imported in `app.ts`
- Workers were created in constructor but never ran
- Jobs queued but never processed (10,211 stuck jobs!)

**Fix**:
- Added service import to `app.ts` to initialize workers on startup
- Workers now process webhooks immediately

### 3. **100% FTP Connection Failures**
**Discovery**: Lines showing 0% success rates, all FTP connections failing.

**Root Cause**:
- Processing 3000+ cruises simultaneously
- No connection pooling or rate limiting
- FTP server overwhelmed and rejecting all connections

**Fix**:
- Batch processing: Max 50 cruises at a time
- Connection pooling with circuit breaker pattern
- Rate limiting: 10 req/s (was 50)
- Reduced workers: 5 (was 10)

### 4. **Security Middleware Blocking Webhooks**
**Discovery**: `curl` requests returning "Access denied"

**Root Cause**:
- Security middleware blocking all curl user agents
- Webhooks couldn't be tested

**Fix**:
- Exempted webhook endpoints from security restrictions
- Allow all webhook requests through

### 5. **Email & Dashboard Changes Not Deploying**
**Discovery**: Changes pushed but not appearing in production

**Root Cause**:
- Production deploys from `production` branch
- Changes were only on `main` branch
- Branch mismatch in deployment configuration

**Fix**:
- Properly merged and pushed to production branch
- Forced deployment with empty commits

## System Architecture Changes

### Before (Batch Sync with Flags)
```
Webhook → Set needs_price_update=true → Wait for cron → Batch sync → Maybe process
Result: Delays, incomplete processing, misleading success messages
```

### After (Real-time Parallel Processing)
```
Webhook → Redis Queue → BullMQ Workers → Parallel FTP → Real updates → Accurate Slack
Result: Immediate processing, real success rates, proper error handling
```

## Key Implementation Details

### BullMQ Configuration
- **Queues**: `realtime-webhooks`, `cruise-processing`
- **Workers**: 5 parallel workers (reduced from 10)
- **Batching**: 50 cruises per batch
- **Rate Limiting**: 10 requests/second
- **Duplicate Prevention**: 5-minute window per cruise line

### FTP Service Improvements
- Connection pooling (max 5 connections)
- Circuit breaker pattern (opens after 5 failures)
- Exponential backoff for retries
- Request queuing with rate limiting
- Proper timeout handling (30s per request)

### Error Handling Enhancements
- Structured error messages (no more `[object Object]`)
- Error categorization (FTP, parsing, database, timeout)
- Detailed Slack notifications with actual failure reasons
- Per-cruise error tracking

## Diagnostic Scripts Created

1. **test-slack-direct.js** - Direct Slack webhook testing
2. **check-redis-bullmq.js** - Redis/BullMQ configuration checker
3. **cleanup-batch-flags.js** - Clear old batch sync flags
4. **direct-cleanup.js** - Direct PostgreSQL cleanup
5. **test-webhook-internal.js** - Internal webhook testing
6. **check-queue-workers.ts** - Worker status monitoring
7. **inspect-redis-jobs.ts** - Redis job inspection
8. **clean-failed-jobs.ts** - Failed job cleanup
9. **verify-fix.ts** - Fix verification

## Performance Improvements

### Before
- 690 cruises max per batch run
- 100% FTP failures for large batches
- 5+ minute processing times
- Duplicate processing common

### After
- Unlimited cruises (processed in batches of 50)
- 60-80% FTP success rates expected
- Sub-minute processing for small batches
- Duplicate prevention built-in

## Lessons Learned

1. **Service Initialization**: Always verify services are imported and initialized at app startup
2. **Connection Management**: FTP servers need connection pooling and rate limiting
3. **Batch Processing**: Large datasets must be processed in manageable chunks
4. **Error Messages**: Structure error objects properly for logging
5. **Deployment Branches**: Verify which branch production deploys from
6. **Security vs Functionality**: Balance security middleware with legitimate access needs
7. **Monitoring**: Real-time processing needs comprehensive monitoring and alerts

## Remaining Considerations

1. **FTP Service Health**: Monitor FTP success rates, may need further tuning
2. **Queue Management**: Monitor Redis memory usage with high webhook volume
3. **Circuit Breaker Tuning**: Adjust thresholds based on actual FTP behavior
4. **Email Domain Verification**: Ensure zipsea.com is verified in Resend

## Configuration Requirements

### Environment Variables Needed
```bash
REDIS_URL=redis://...
SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL=https://hooks.slack.com/...
RESEND_API_KEY=re_...
TRAVELTEK_FTP_USER=...
TRAVELTEK_FTP_PASSWORD=...
```

### Redis Setup
- Redis server running and accessible
- BullMQ queues initialized automatically
- Workers start with application

## Next Steps

1. Monitor FTP success rates over next 24 hours
2. Tune rate limiting based on FTP server capacity
3. Consider implementing retry queue for failed cruises
4. Add dashboard for queue monitoring
5. Set up alerts for circuit breaker activation

## Summary

Transformed the webhook processing from a deferred batch system to real-time parallel processing with proper error handling, connection management, and monitoring. Fixed critical issues preventing system operation and improved reliability from 0% to expected 60-80% success rates.
