# Session: October 25, 2025 - Dropdown Click-Outside & Pricing Discrepancy Debugging

**Date:** October 25, 2025  
**Duration:** ~2 hours  
**Focus:** Two critical issues - dropdown click-outside detection and cabin pricing mismatch  
**Branch:** main (staging)  
**Status:** In Progress - Debugging pricing discrepancy

---

## Session Summary

This session focused on two separate issues:
1. Homepage dropdown click-outside detection not working (dropdowns close when clicking inside)
2. Cabin pricing showing $1,995 but basket returning $2,770 (live booking feature)

---

## Issue 1: Dropdown Click-Outside Detection

### Problem
User reported dropdowns on homepage still closing when clicking inside them. Checkboxes/options would deselect immediately.

### Investigation Steps

**Initial Diagnosis:**
- Added comprehensive debugging to useEffect hook
- User provided console logs showing `contains: false` even for clicks inside dropdown
- Logs showed `isOpen: false` when clicking inside (stale closure issue)

**Root Cause Analysis:**
1. Empty dependency array `[]` in useEffect causes handler to capture initial state (all false)
2. Handler never sees updated state values
3. `.contains()` check was correct, but we were also checking stale `isOpen` state

**Changes Made:**

Commit `6930d8f` - Initial debugging with extensive logging
Commit `1924dfb` - Simplified logic and added DOM structure logging

Final implementation:
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  const handleClickOutside = (event: MouseEvent) => {
    const target = event.target as Node;
    
    // Just check if ref exists and click is outside - no state checks needed
    if (guestsDropdownRef.current && !guestsDropdownRef.current.contains(target)) {
      setIsGuestsDropdownOpen(false);
    }
    // Repeat for other dropdowns...
  };
  
  document.addEventListener("mousedown", handleClickOutside);
  return () => document.removeEventListener("mousedown", handleClickOutside);
}, []); // Empty deps is correct - refs are stable
```

**Key Insight:** Don't check state inside the handler when using empty dependency array. The ref check is sufficient - if ref exists, dropdown is open.

**Status:** Waiting for user to test latest changes (commit `1924dfb`)

## Issue 2: Live Booking Cabin Pricing Discrepancy

### Problem
Cabin displays $1,995.24 but after clicking "Reserve", the basket/options page shows $2,770.

### Investigation Steps

**Frontend Logging Added:**
- Added detailed logging when "Reserve This Cabin" is clicked
- Logs show what price is displayed and what parameters are sent to API
- File: `frontend/app/cruise/[slug]/CruiseDetailClient.tsx`

**Backend Logging Added:**
- Added full JSON dump of Traveltek basketadd response
- Added specific logging of all pricing fields
- File: `backend/src/services/traveltek-booking.service.ts`

**Commits:**
- `7925fb1` - Added comprehensive pricing debugging to both frontend and backend

### Findings from Console Logs

**Frontend (Cabin Display):**
```
üí∞ RESERVE CLICKED - Cabin Pricing Data:
  displayedPrice: 1995.24
  resultNo: '225_0.1399212172'
  gradeNo: '225:DC508897:7'
  rateCode: 'DC508897'
  cabinName: 'Guarantee Interior'
```

**Backend (Basket Response):**
```
üõí basketData.results[0]: 
  totalprice: 0  ‚ùå Zero!
  totaldeposit: 0
üíµ Using searchprice as fallback
üíµ Extracted totalprice: 2770
```

### Root Cause Analysis

**Data Flow:**
1. Frontend displays `$1,995.24` from `cabin.ratesByCode['DC508897'].price`
2. Frontend sends correct parameters: `resultNo`, `gradeNo`, `rateCode` to basket API
3. Backend calls Traveltek `basketadd.pl` with those exact parameters
4. Traveltek returns `totalprice: 0` (common issue per our code comments)
5. Backend uses `searchprice: 2770` as fallback (this is correct per our implementation)
6. Frontend displays the `searchprice` value: $2,770

**The Mystery:**
- Why is `ratesByCode['DC508897'].price` = $1,995.24?
- Why is `searchprice` in basket = $2,770?
- Difference of $775 ($2,770 - $1,995 = $775)

**Hypotheses:**
1. **Per-person vs Total:** Maybe $1,995 is per person and $2,770 is total for 2 adults?
   - If true: $1,995 x 2 = $3,990 ‚â† $2,770 ‚ùå Doesn't match
2. **Different rate codes:** Frontend might be showing wrong rate's price
3. **Stale pricing:** Frontend cached data is outdated vs live basket pricing
4. **Taxes/fees included:** One price includes fees, other doesn't

**Next Steps Required:**
1. Expand `ratesByCode['DC508897']` object to see all fields
2. Get backend logs showing full `üì¶ Raw basket response` from Traveltek
3. Check if `searchprice` is documented in Traveltek API docs
4. Determine which price is the "correct" one to display

### Related Code Locations

**Frontend Pricing Display:**
- File: `frontend/app/cruise/[slug]/CruiseDetailClient.tsx`
- Function: `getCabinPricingForRate(cabin)` (line ~146)
- Logic: Uses `cabin.ratesByCode[selectedRateCode].price` or falls back to `cabin.cheapestPrice`

**Backend Basket Normalization:**
- File: `backend/src/services/traveltek-booking.service.ts`
- Section: Lines 659-683
- Logic: When `totalprice: 0`, uses `basketItem.searchprice` as fallback
- Comment notes: "Traveltek often returns totalprice=0... but searchprice is always accurate"

**Frontend Basket Display:**
- File: `frontend/app/booking/[sessionId]/options/PricingSummary.tsx` (likely)
- Shows the `searchprice` value from basket response

## Files Modified This Session

### Frontend
- `frontend/app/page.tsx` - Dropdown click-outside detection fixes and debugging
- `frontend/app/cruise/[slug]/CruiseDetailClient.tsx` - Added pricing debugging

### Backend
- `backend/src/services/traveltek-booking.service.ts` - Added basket response debugging

---

## Deployment Status

**Staging (main branch):**
- ‚úÖ Commit `6930d8f` - Dropdown debugging (initial)
- ‚úÖ Commit `7925fb1` - Pricing debugging (frontend + backend)
- ‚úÖ Commit `1924dfb` - Dropdown fix attempt (simplified logic)

**Production:**
- No changes pushed (per user request - staging only for testing)

---

## Current Blockers

### Dropdown Issue
- **Status:** Fix deployed to staging, waiting for user testing
- **Blocker:** Need user to test and confirm if dropdowns now work correctly

### Pricing Issue
- **Status:** Debugging in progress
- **Blocker:** Need to see:
  1. Expanded `ratesByCode['DC508897']` object from frontend console
  2. Backend Render logs showing `üì¶ Raw basket response`
  3. Understand Traveltek's pricing structure (per-person vs total, what searchprice means)

---

## Technical Decisions

### Dropdown Click-Outside Pattern
**Decision:** Use empty dependency array with ref-only checks
**Rationale:** 
- Refs are stable and don't need to be in dependencies
- State checks inside handler with empty deps = stale closure
- Just checking `ref.current.contains(target)` is sufficient
- If ref exists, dropdown is rendered (open)

### Pricing Fallback Strategy
**Decision:** Use `searchprice` when `totalprice: 0`
**Rationale:**
- Traveltek commonly returns `totalprice: 0` in basket response
- `searchprice` field always has accurate pricing
- This is documented in our code comments from earlier work

---

## Questions for Next Session

1. **Pricing Structure:** Is `searchprice` the total for all passengers or per-person?
2. **Rate Codes:** Does `DC508897` have multiple prices depending on context?
3. **Frontend Data:** Where does `ratesByCode` come from - cabin grades API?
4. **Correct Price:** Which price should we trust and display - the one from cabin grades or searchprice?

---

## Next Actions

### Immediate (Waiting on User)
- [ ] User tests dropdown fix on staging
- [ ] User provides expanded `ratesByCode['DC508897']` object
- [ ] User/Dev checks Render backend logs for `üì¶ Raw basket response`

### Once We Have Data
- [ ] Analyze Traveltek basket response structure
- [ ] Determine if prices are per-person or total
- [ ] Fix frontend to display correct price (match what basket will show)
- [ ] Update pricing display logic to be consistent

### Nice to Have
- [ ] Document Traveltek pricing fields in `TRAVELTEK-API-CALL-CHAIN.md`
- [ ] Add validation that displayed price matches basket price
- [ ] Add warning if prices don't match

## Session End Notes

**Time Remaining:** ~25% context left
**Status:** Active debugging - need more data to proceed
**Priority:** Pricing issue is higher priority (affects user trust)
