# FTP Debugging Session - Connection Works, Sync Process Investigation

**Date:** December 20, 2024  
**Time:** Evening session  
**Status:** FTP credentials confirmed working, investigating sync process

## Session Summary

Continued from previous session where FTP credentials were confirmed working. Now investigating why data isn't populating despite successful FTP connection.

## Investigation Findings

### 1. FTP Connection Status
- ✅ Connection successful to ftpeu1prod.traveltek.net
- ✅ User CEP_9_USD authenticated
- ✅ Can list directories (years 2022-2026 visible)
- ✅ Basic FTP operations working

### 2. Sync Process Analysis

#### Data Flow Discovered:
```
FTP Files → Download → Parse JSON → Database Transaction → Price History → Cache Clear
```

#### Key Components:
1. **TraveltekFTPService** (`src/services/traveltek-ftp.service.ts`)
   - Handles FTP connection and file operations
   - Discovery of cruise files by year/month/line/ship
   - Batch download capabilities

2. **DataSyncService** (`src/services/data-sync.service.ts`)
   - Processes downloaded JSON files
   - Creates/updates database records
   - Manages relationships between tables
   - Integrates with price history system

3. **Trigger Points**:
   - Cron jobs (daily, weekly)
   - Manual admin API endpoint: `/api/v1/admin/sync/trigger`
   - Webhook events (selective sync)

### 3. Potential Issues Identified

The sync process might be failing at several points:

1. **File Discovery**: The `discoverCruiseFiles()` method traverses deeply nested directories
2. **JSON Parsing**: Files need valid JSON structure
3. **Database Transactions**: Complex multi-table inserts with foreign keys
4. **Missing Dependencies**: Some IDs might not exist (cruise lines, ships, ports)

### 4. Debugging Scripts Created

#### A. `test-ftp-detailed.js`
Complete FTP functionality test that:
- Navigates through year/month/line/ship directories
- Lists available JSON files
- Downloads and parses a sample file
- Provides step-by-step success/failure reporting

#### B. `trigger-sync.js`
Manual sync trigger that:
- Tests FTP connection
- Discovers available files
- Downloads and syncs a test file
- Verifies database insertion
- Shows detailed error messages

## Next Steps for Debugging

### Run These Commands in Render Shell:

1. **Test FTP navigation and file access:**
```bash
cd /opt/render/project/src/backend
node scripts/test-ftp-detailed.js
```

2. **Attempt manual sync with debugging:**
```bash
cd /opt/render/project/src/backend
node scripts/trigger-sync.js
```

3. **Check application logs for sync attempts:**
```bash
# In Render dashboard, check logs after running:
curl -X POST https://zipsea-production.onrender.com/api/v1/admin/sync/trigger \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"type": "recent"}'
```

## Possible Solutions

### If File Discovery Fails:
- Files might be in different year/month than expected
- Directory structure might have changed
- Permissions issue on specific directories

### If JSON Parsing Fails:
- File format might have changed
- Encoding issues
- Corrupted or incomplete downloads

### If Database Insert Fails:
- Foreign key constraints (missing cruise lines/ships)
- Data type mismatches
- Transaction rollback on any error

### If Everything Works Manually but Not Automatically:
- Environment variable differences
- Memory/timeout limits in production
- Cron job not running

## Environment Variables Confirmed

All required FTP variables are set in Render:
- ✅ TRAVELTEK_FTP_HOST=ftpeu1prod.traveltek.net
- ✅ TRAVELTEK_FTP_USER=CEP_9_USD
- ✅ TRAVELTEK_FTP_PASSWORD=[confirmed set]

## Quick Test Commands

```bash
# Test FTP connection only
curl https://zipsea-production.onrender.com/health/detailed

# Check if any cruises exist
curl https://zipsea-production.onrender.com/api/v1/search \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"limit": 1}'

# Trigger manual sync
curl -X POST https://zipsea-production.onrender.com/api/v1/admin/sync/trigger \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"type": "recent"}'
```

## Important Notes

1. **FTP is working** - Connection and authentication successful
2. **Sync process exists** - Code is complete and should work
3. **Next step is debugging** - Need to run scripts in Render shell to see where it fails
4. **Price history ready** - System will track prices once data flows
