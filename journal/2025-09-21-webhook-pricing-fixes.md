# Session Journal: Webhook Processing & Pricing Fixes
**Date**: September 21, 2025  
**Branch**: production  
**Deployment**: zipsea-production.onrender.com

## Executive Summary
Fixed critical issues in the webhook processing pipeline and pricing data flow. The system was not properly tracking webhook completion status, had pricing unit inconsistencies for Riviera Travel, and encountered metadata corruption in the database.

## Key Issues Discovered & Fixed

### 1. Webhook Status Never Completing (ðŸ”´ Critical)
**Problem**: Webhook events were stuck in 'processing' status forever. BullMQ workers completed jobs but never updated the database status.

**Root Cause**: Missing database update logic after job completion in the worker's 'completed' event handler.

**Solution**: 
- Added batch tracking with Maps to track completion across multiple job batches
- Implemented webhook event ID tracking through the entire job queue
- Added proper status updates when all batches complete

**Files Modified**:
- `/backend/src/services/webhook-processor-optimized-v2.service.ts`
- `/backend/src/routes/webhook.routes.ts`

### 2. Riviera Travel Pricing Error (ðŸ”´ Critical)
**Problem**: Riviera Travel (line 329) prices were inflated by 1000x (e.g., $299,000 instead of $299).

**Discovery Process**:
1. Checked FTP raw data: Prices already inflated (e.g., 299000)
2. Compared with other cruise lines: Others use normal dollars
3. Conclusion: Riviera sends prices in penceÃ—10 format

**Solution**: 
```javascript
// In webhook-processor-optimized-v2.service.ts
if (lineId === 329) {
  parsed = parsed / 1000;
}
```

### 3. Database Metadata Corruption (ðŸŸ¡ Medium)
**Problem**: PostgreSQL error "cannot set path in scalar" when updating webhook_events metadata field.

**Root Cause**: Some webhook_events had scalar values in metadata field instead of JSON objects, causing `jsonb_set` to fail.

**Solution**:
```sql
-- Check if metadata is object before using jsonb_set
metadata = CASE 
  WHEN metadata IS NULL OR jsonb_typeof(metadata) != 'object' 
  THEN jsonb_build_object('completed_at', NOW())
  ELSE jsonb_set(metadata, '{completed_at}', to_jsonb(NOW()))
END
```

### 4. Environment Variable Issues (ðŸŸ¡ Medium)
**Problem**: DATABASE_URL not available despite being set in Render.

**Root Cause**: Environment validation was exiting the app on validation failures.

**Solution**: Made environment validation non-fatal with fallback values.

### 5. FTP Connection Pool Exhaustion (ðŸŸ¡ Medium)
**Problem**: "Server sent FIN packet unexpectedly" errors in production.

**Solution**:
- Reduced MAX_CONNECTIONS from 8 to 3
- Added connection delays between batches
- Improved retry logic for FIN packet errors

## Production Deployment Challenges
- **Wrong URL**: Initially tested `zipsea-backend.onrender.com` instead of `zipsea-production.onrender.com`
- **Auto-deploy delays**: Had to wait for manual deployments multiple times
- **Missing endpoints**: Several monitoring endpoints were missing

## New Monitoring Tools Added

### 1. Queue Status Endpoint
```bash
GET /api/webhooks/queue-status
```
Shows BullMQ queue counts, worker status, and sample jobs.

### 2. Recent Webhooks Endpoint  
```bash
GET /api/webhooks/recent?limit=10
```
Lists recent webhook events with status and metadata.

### 3. Webhook Status Check
```bash
GET /api/webhooks/status/:eventId
```
Check specific webhook event status.

## Test Scripts Created
- `/backend/scripts/test-master-pipeline.js` - Comprehensive pipeline test
- `/backend/scripts/cleanup-stuck-webhooks.js` - Cleanup utility for stuck events
- `/backend/scripts/test-bullmq-production.js` - BullMQ connectivity test

## Database Cleanup
- Found 2,503 webhook events stuck in 'processing' status
- Only 16 events had ever reached 'completed' status
- Marked 2,502 stuck events as 'failed' for cleanup

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Price Unit Assumptions
**Never assume price units are consistent across providers**. Riviera Travel sends prices in a unique format (penceÃ—10) while others use standard dollars. Always verify with source data.

### 2. Webhook Completion Tracking
**BullMQ job completion â‰  Business logic completion**. Must explicitly update database records when async jobs complete.

### 3. JSONB Field Safety
**Always validate JSONB field types before operations**. Use defensive SQL with CASE statements when field content is uncertain.

### 4. Environment Validation
**Fatal validation can break production**. Use warning-level validation with sensible defaults for non-critical config.

### 5. Connection Pool Management
**FTP servers have connection limits**. Use conservative pool sizes and implement proper retry/backoff strategies.

## Current Status
âœ… Webhook processing pipeline fully functional  
âœ… Riviera Travel prices correctly divided by 1000  
âœ… Batch tracking ensures all jobs complete before marking webhook done  
âœ… Metadata corruption handled gracefully  
âœ… Monitoring endpoints available for debugging  

## Next Steps Recommended
1. Add Slack/email alerts for failed webhooks
2. Implement automatic retry for failed FTP connections  
3. Add price validation rules to catch future unit discrepancies
4. Set up regular cleanup job for stuck webhook events
5. Add comprehensive logging for price transformations

## Commands for Verification
```bash
# Check queue status
curl https://zipsea-production.onrender.com/api/webhooks/queue-status | jq '.'

# Check recent webhooks
curl https://zipsea-production.onrender.com/api/webhooks/recent?limit=5 | jq '.'

# Test webhook trigger
curl -X POST https://zipsea-production.onrender.com/api/webhooks/traveltek \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"event": "cruises_live_pricing_updated", "paths": ["2025/09/329/1/1001.json"]}'

# Run comprehensive pipeline test
cd backend && node scripts/test-master-pipeline.js
```
