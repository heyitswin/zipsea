# 2025-10-17: Passenger Selector Frontend Implementation

## Session Overview
Continued from previous session after completing TypeScript/Drizzle fixes. Implemented the first frontend component for the live booking flow: PassengerSelector on the homepage.

## What Was Built

### 1. PassengerSelector Component
**File:** `frontend/app/components/PassengerSelector.tsx` (280 lines)

**Features:**
- Adult counter: 1-8 passengers (default: 2)
- Children counter: 0-6 passengers (default: 0)
- Child age inputs: 0-17 years per child
- Dropdown UI with plus/minus counters
- Click-outside-to-close functionality
- Mobile responsive design
- Matches Zipsea design system (colors, shadows, spacing)

**Interface:**
```typescript
interface PassengerCount {
  adults: number;
  children: number;
  childAges: number[];
}

interface PassengerSelectorProps {
  value: PassengerCount;
  onChange: (value: PassengerCount) => void;
  className?: string;
}
```

**Key Implementation Details:**
- Uses React hooks: useState, useRef, useEffect
- Click outside detection for dropdown close
- Dynamic child age inputs (appear/disappear as children count changes)
- Validation: Can't have 0 adults, can't exceed max passengers
- Accessibility: Proper button labels and semantic HTML

### 2. Homepage Integration
**File:** `frontend/app/page.tsx` (modified)

**Changes:**
1. Added import:
```typescript
import PassengerSelector from "./components/PassengerSelector";
```

2. Added state management:
```typescript
const [passengerCount, setPassengerCount] = useState({
  adults: 2,
  children: 0,
  childAges: [] as number[],
});
```

3. Modified search handler to persist passenger data:
```typescript
const handleSearchClick = () => {
  // Store passenger count for cruise detail page
  sessionStorage.setItem("passengerCount", JSON.stringify(passengerCount));
  router.push("/cruises");
};
```

4. Integrated component into hero section:
```tsx
{/* Passenger Selector */}
<div className="w-full max-w-[400px] mb-4">
  <PassengerSelector
    value={passengerCount}
    onChange={setPassengerCount}
  />
</div>

{/* Search Button (already existed) */}
<Link href="/cruises" onClick={handleSearchClick}>
  <button className="bg-orange-500 text-white px-8 py-3 rounded-full text-lg font-semibold hover:bg-orange-600 transition-colors">
    Find my cruise
  </button>
</Link>
```

**Placement:** Component appears between the hero text and the "Find my cruise" button in the center column of the hero section.

## Deployment Status

### Committed Changes
- ‚úÖ Committed to main branch (commit 6250336)
- ‚è≥ NOT merged to production (per user request: "make sure staging works fully first")
- üß™ Currently testing on localhost:3000

### Frontend Server Status
- Running on http://localhost:3000
- Next.js 15.5.0 in production mode
- Ready for testing

## Testing Plan

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Component renders correctly on homepage
- [ ] Adult counter increments/decrements (1-8 range)
- [ ] Children counter increments/decrements (0-6 range)
- [ ] Child age inputs appear when children > 0
- [ ] Child age inputs disappear when children = 0
- [ ] Each child has individual age selector (0-17)
- [ ] Dropdown opens on click
- [ ] Dropdown closes when clicking outside
- [ ] Passenger data persists to sessionStorage on search
- [ ] Mobile responsive behavior
- [ ] Visual design matches Zipsea style

### SessionStorage Verification
After clicking "Find my cruise", check browser console:
```javascript
JSON.parse(sessionStorage.getItem("passengerCount"))
// Should return: { adults: 2, children: 0, childAges: [] }
```

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Current Session)
1. Test PassengerSelector on localhost
2. Verify sessionStorage persistence
3. Create session journal entry

### Short Term (Next Frontend Tasks)
1. Update cruise detail page to:
   - Retrieve passenger count from sessionStorage
   - Display passenger count in UI
   - Pass to booking session creation API
2. Begin cruise detail page rebuild for live cabin selection
3. Create cabin selection UI with pricing

### Medium Term (Booking Flow Pages)
1. Options Selection page (`/booking/:sessionId/options`)
2. Passenger Details page (`/booking/:sessionId/passengers`)
3. Payment & Review page (`/booking/:sessionId/payment`)
4. Confirmation page (`/booking/:bookingId/confirmation`)

### Long Term
- Deploy to staging after testing
- User tests staging thoroughly
- Deploy to production after staging approval

## Technical Notes

### Why SessionStorage?
- Passenger count needs to persist across page navigation (homepage ‚Üí cruise detail)
- SessionStorage is perfect for single-tab booking flow data
- Cleared automatically when browser tab closes
- No server-side storage needed for initial search parameters

### Design Decisions
1. **Default to 2 adults:** Most cruise bookings are couples
2. **Max 8 adults + 6 children:** Based on typical cabin capacity limits
3. **Individual child ages:** Required for accurate pricing (Traveltek API requirement)
4. **Dropdown UI:** Saves vertical space on mobile, familiar pattern
5. **Counter buttons:** More intuitive than text input for quantities

### Component Reusability
PassengerSelector is fully reusable. Can be used in:
- Homepage (current)
- Cruise detail page (if user wants to modify)
- Booking flow pages (for confirmation display)
- Account/manage bookings page

## Files Modified
- `frontend/app/components/PassengerSelector.tsx` (NEW - 280 lines)
- `frontend/app/page.tsx` (MODIFIED - added selector integration)
