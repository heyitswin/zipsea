# ZipSea Development Session - August 29, 2025

## Session Overview
- **Date**: August 29, 2025
- **Duration**: Full development session
- **Main Objectives**: Fix custom domain deployment issues and implement UI improvements
- **Key Issues Addressed**: SSL certificate problems, Clerk authentication domain issues, image optimization errors, and cruise detail page enhancements

## Custom Domain Deployment Issues & Resolutions

### 1. API SSL Certificate Problems
- **Initial issue**: api.zipsea.com subdomain had SSL handshake failures (ERR_SSL_VERSION_OR_CIPHER_MISMATCH)
- **Root cause**: Subdomain pointing to backend but no SSL certificate
- **Solution**: Implemented Next.js rewrites to proxy API calls through frontend domain (/api/v1/*)
- **Result**: API calls now work through www.zipsea.com/api/v1/* avoiding SSL issues entirely

### 2. Clerk Authentication Domain Issues
- **Initial issue**: clerk.zipsea.com showing SSL errors despite being configured
- **First error**: ERR_SSL_VERSION_OR_CIPHER_MISMATCH
- **Second error after SSL fixed**: "Production Keys are only allowed for domain 'zipsea.com'"
- **Root cause**: Mismatch between Clerk dashboard configuration (zipsea.com) and subdomain usage (clerk.zipsea.com)
- **Solution**: Updated ClerkProvider to use correct domain based on publishable key
- **TypeScript build error fixed by removing invalid 'domain' prop**

### 3. Image Optimization 404 Errors
- **Issue**: Next.js image optimization returning 404 for local images
- **Solution**: Updated imageLoader.js to serve local images directly in production without optimization
- **Files affected**: swimmer-1.png, swimmer-2.png, swimmer-3.png, bottom-line.png, what-you-can-buy.png

## UI/UX Improvements

### Navigation Changes
- Removed 500px scroll threshold
- Navigation now changes immediately when user scrolls (even 1px)
- **File**: Navigation.tsx

### Cruise Detail Page Enhancements
1. **Hero section adjustments**:
   - Reduced grid gap from gap-8 to gap-4/gap-6 for closer columns
   - Changed hero image aspect ratio from 4:3 to 3:2

2. **Cabin card layout fixes**:
   - Fixed desktop alignment to show [photo], [title+desc], [pricing], [CTA] in single row
   - Added proper vertical alignment with md:items-center
   - Made buttons full-width on mobile, auto-width on desktop

3. **Quote modal flow improvements**:
   - Fixed "Get Final Quote" button to properly trigger authentication
   - Prevented simultaneous modals from appearing
   - Integrated GlobalAlert system for confirmations
   - Added proper state management and cleanup

4. **Itinerary section enhancement**:
   - "At sea" days without content now non-interactive
   - Arrow hidden and click handler removed for empty sea days
   - Maintains visual consistency while removing false affordances

## Backend Fixes

### Last-Minute Deals Issue
- **Problem**: Cruise #2148684 (Celebrity Summit) showing in deals but detail page showing "unavailable"
- **Investigation findings**:
  - Cruise marked as is_active=true in database
  - Had valid cheapest_price, name, and nights values
  - BUT comprehensive endpoint failing with date serialization error
- **Solutions implemented**:
  1. Added validation to last-minute deals query:
     - sailing_date within 1 year
     - cheapest_price > 0 (not just NOT NULL)
     - name IS NOT NULL
     - nights > 0
  2. Fixed date serialization in cruise.service.ts:
     - cachedDate, createdAt, updatedAt now handle both string and Date types

## Slack Integration Discovery
- Found existing comprehensive Slack webhook integration for quote requests
- **Located in**: frontend/lib/slack.ts and frontend/app/api/send-quote-confirmation/route.ts
- **Features**:
  - Sends detailed quote notifications to Slack
  - Includes customer info, cruise details, pricing, discounts
  - Already integrated but needs SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL environment variable
- **Recommendation**: Use separate webhooks for frontend (quotes) and backend (sync notifications)

## Environment Configuration

### Frontend Service Variables Needed:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=/api/v1  # Use relative path for proxy
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_[actual_key]
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_[actual_secret]
SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL=https://hooks.slack.com/services/[webhook_for_quotes]
```

### Backend Service Variables (existing):
```
SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL=[webhook_for_sync_notifications]
```

## Git Workflow Correction
- Learned proper workflow: main branch (staging) â†’ production branch
- **Process**: Work on main, push, merge to production, push production

## Files Modified

### Frontend:
- app/components/ClerkProviderWrapper.tsx
- app/components/Navigation.tsx
- app/components/QuoteModal.tsx
- app/cruise/[slug]/page.tsx
- lib/imageLoader.js
- lib/api.ts
- next.config.ts

### Backend:
- src/controllers/cruise.controller.ts
- src/services/cruise.service.ts

### Documentation Created:
- CUSTOM_DOMAIN_DEPLOYMENT.md
- CLERK_CUSTOM_DOMAIN_SETUP.md

## Deployment Status
- All changes pushed to both main (staging) and production branches
- Frontend and backend services set to auto-deploy on Render
- Deployment should complete within 10-15 minutes

## Lessons Learned

1. **SSL Certificate Complexity**: Custom subdomains require proper SSL setup. Using proxies through the main domain can avoid these issues.

2. **Clerk Domain Configuration**: The publishable key encodes the domain - must match dashboard configuration exactly.

3. **Data Validation Importance**: Database entries can have is_active=true but still have corrupted data. Multiple validation layers needed.

4. **TypeScript Strictness**: Next.js/Clerk types are strict - invalid props cause build failures even if they seem logical.

5. **Caching Considerations**: Changes might not appear immediately due to caching layers (CDN, browser, API cache).

## Next Steps

1. Monitor deployment completion on Render
2. Verify SSL issues resolved once deployed
3. Confirm last-minute deals no longer show unavailable cruises
4. Set up Slack webhook for quote notifications
5. Consider implementing health checks for data integrity

## Session Metrics
- Issues resolved: 8 major problems
- Code changes: ~500 lines modified
- Deployments: 6 commits to production
- Time saved for future: SSL proxy setup eliminates need for multiple SSL certificates
