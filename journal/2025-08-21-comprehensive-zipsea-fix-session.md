# Zipsea Backend Fix Session - August 21, 2025

## Session Overview
This was a comprehensive debugging and fixing session for the Zipsea cruise platform backend. The primary issue was cruise line and ship names displaying as IDs (like "CL17" and "Ship 410") instead of actual readable names. Through investigation, we discovered multiple interconnected issues affecting data sync, database schemas, and API functionality.

## Timeline of Work Completed

### 1. Initial Problem Discovery (Morning)
- **Issue**: Cruise lines showing as "CL17", ships as "Ship 410" instead of real names
- **Root Cause Identified**: Sync scripts were extracting names from wrong fields in Traveltek FTP JSON data
- **Impact**: All cruise data in database had meaningless ID-based names instead of user-friendly names

### 2. Sync Script Field Mapping Fixes (9:00 AM - 11:00 AM)
**Problem**: Original sync was using incorrect JSON fields:
- Using `linename` instead of `linecontent.enginename` for cruise line names
- Using `shipname` instead of `shipcontent.name` for ship names

**Scripts Created/Modified**:
- `sync-sept-onwards.js` - Fixed field mappings with correct extraction
- `sync-by-month.js` - Month-by-month targeted sync with resume capability
- `sync-with-resume.js` - Resumable sync with progress tracking for large datasets

**Key Code Fixes**:
```javascript
// WRONG (original):
cruise_line_name: cruise.linename || 'Unknown'
ship_name: cruise.shipname || 'Unknown'

// CORRECT (fixed):
cruise_line_name: cruise.linecontent?.enginename || cruise.linename || 'Unknown'
ship_name: cruise.shipcontent?.name || cruise.shipname || 'Unknown'
```

### 3. Database Schema Issues (11:00 AM - 1:00 PM)
**Problem**: Staging database missing columns that exist in production
- Missing: `country_code`, `state`, `images` columns in ports table
- Causing sync failures and data inconsistencies

**Scripts Created**:
- `fix-staging-ports-schema.js` - Add missing columns to staging
- `fix-staging-ports-images.js` - Specifically handle images column
- `fix-all-staging-columns.js` - Comprehensive column fixes

**Database Issues Encountered**:
- Column type mismatches between environments
- Foreign key constraint violations
- Index recreation failures

### 4. Name Update and Data Correction (1:00 PM - 3:00 PM)
**Created Multiple Approaches**:
- `fix-names-correct-fields.js` - Fix existing bad names in database
- `update-names-only.js` - Targeted name-only updates without full resync
- `sync-simple-upsert.js` - Name-focused upsert operations

**Challenges**:
- Large dataset size causing timeouts
- Memory issues with bulk operations
- Need to maintain data integrity during updates

### 5. API and Search Fixes (3:00 PM - 4:00 PM)
**Search API Runtime Errors**:
- Error: "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'map')"
- Location: `search-optimized-simple.service.ts`

**Fixes Applied**:
```typescript
// Added safe property access
const cruiseIds = results?.map?.(result => result.cruise_id) || [];
const cabinCategories = results?.map?.(result => result.cabin_category_id) || [];
```

**Files Modified**:
- `src/services/search-optimized-simple.service.ts`
- `src/services/search-hotfix.service.ts`

### 6. Testing and Monitoring (4:00 PM - 5:00 PM)
**Scripts Created**:
- `test-search-api.sh` - Comprehensive API endpoint testing
- `check-webhook-health.js` - Webhook failure diagnosis
- `test-search-directly.js` - Direct service testing

**Testing Results**:
- Production API shows correct names (NCL, Royal Caribbean)
- Search endpoint functional but with some query edge cases
- Webhook showing high failure rates: 102 failed vs 30 successful

### 7. Database Reset Strategy (5:00 PM - 6:00 PM)
**Decision Made**: Complete database reset and resync required
- Staging data too corrupted to repair incrementally
- Production needs clean sync with correct field mappings

**Scripts Prepared**:
- `recreate-schema.js` - Complete table recreation from Drizzle schema
- `reset-and-resync.sh` - Automated reset and sync process

## Current System State

### Production Environment
- ‚úÖ **Names**: Correct (NCL, Royal Caribbean, etc.)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Data Completeness**: Incomplete due to sync timeouts
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Search API**: Working but with some edge case errors
- ‚ùå **Webhooks**: High failure rate (102 failures vs 30 successes)

### Staging Environment  
- ‚ùå **Names**: Still showing IDs (CL17, Ship 410)
- ‚ùå **Schema**: Missing columns, inconsistent structure
- ‚ùå **Data**: Corrupted from multiple failed sync attempts
- **Status**: Ready for complete reset

### API Endpoints Status
- `/api/v1/health` - ‚úÖ Working
- `/api/v1/cruises` - ‚úÖ Working (correct names in production)
- `/api/v1/search` - ‚ö†Ô∏è Working but with runtime errors on some queries
- `/api/v1/search-optimized` - ‚ö†Ô∏è Fixed but needs more testing

## Problems Encountered and Solutions

### 1. FTP Sync Timeouts
**Problem**: ECONNRESET errors, connection timeouts during large syncs
**Solutions Attempted**:
- Batch processing with smaller sizes
- Resume functionality
- Connection pooling and retry logic
- Month-by-month syncing

### 2. Database Schema Drift
**Problem**: Staging and production schemas out of sync
**Root Cause**: Manual changes not reflected in migrations
**Solution**: Complete schema recreation using Drizzle definitions

### 3. Memory Issues with Large Datasets
**Problem**: Node.js heap out of memory during bulk operations
**Solutions**:
- Batch processing (5-10 records at a time)
- Stream processing for large files
- Garbage collection optimization

### 4. Webhook Reliability
**Problem**: 77% failure rate on webhooks
**Investigation Needed**: 
- Error logging insufficient
- Timeout configurations
- Rate limiting issues

## Next Steps (In Priority Order)

### Phase 1: Complete Staging Reset (IMMEDIATE)
1. **Reset Staging Database**
   ```bash
   node scripts/recreate-schema.js
   ```

2. **Sync Clean Data**
   ```bash
   YEAR=2025 MONTH=9 BATCH_SIZE=5 node scripts/sync-by-month.js
   ```

3. **Verify Data Quality**
   - Check that cruise lines show real names (not CL17)
   - Test search API endpoints
   - Verify all tables have correct schema

### Phase 2: Production Sync (After staging success)
1. **Backup Production Database**
2. **Apply Same Reset Process**
3. **Full Data Sync with Correct Mappings**
4. **API Testing and Validation**

### Phase 3: Webhook Investigation and Fixes
1. **Analyze Webhook Failures**
   - Review error logs
   - Check timeout configurations
   - Validate webhook endpoint responses

2. **Implement Webhook Reliability Improvements**
   - Better error handling
   - Retry mechanisms
   - Rate limiting adjustments

### Phase 4: System Optimization
1. **Search API Performance**
   - Optimize database queries
   - Implement better caching
   - Fix remaining edge cases

2. **FTP Sync Reliability**
   - Connection pooling
   - Better timeout handling
   - Resume functionality improvements

## Important Notes and Warnings

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Warnings
1. **Database Reset Risk**: Complete data loss if not done correctly
2. **FTP Timeouts**: Large syncs may timeout, use month-by-month approach
3. **Production Timing**: Avoid resets during peak usage hours
4. **Backup Strategy**: Always backup before major changes

### üí° Key Learnings
1. **Field Mappings**: Always verify JSON structure before extraction
2. **Schema Management**: Keep migrations in sync with manual changes
3. **Batch Processing**: Large datasets require careful memory management
4. **Testing Strategy**: Always test on staging before production

### üîß Technical Debt Identified
1. **Webhook Error Handling**: Insufficient logging and retry mechanisms
2. **Schema Migrations**: Need automated verification between environments  
3. **FTP Connection Management**: Needs more robust connection handling
4. **API Error Responses**: Inconsistent error format across endpoints

## Success Metrics to Track
- [ ] Cruise line names show as readable text (not IDs)
- [ ] Ship names show as readable text (not IDs) 
- [ ] Search API returns results without runtime errors
- [ ] Webhook success rate above 95%
- [ ] FTP sync completes without timeouts
- [ ] All API endpoints respond within acceptable time limits
