# Zipsea Development Session - August 27, 2025

## Session Overview
This was a critical debugging and infrastructure session focused on fixing webhook processing and implementing robust batch sync capabilities for the Zipsea cruise pricing system. The session involved discovering major database query issues, implementing concurrency controls, and establishing a reliable price update workflow.

**Project Location**: `/Users/winlin/Desktop/sites/zipsea`  
**Session Date**: August 27, 2025  
**Duration**: Full debugging and implementation session  
**Branch**: main  
**Focus**: Webhook processing fixes, batch sync V3 implementation, database migration issues

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Critical Bug Discovery and Fix - `db.execute()` Return Format

#### The Problem
- V2 batch sync was finding files but getting 9 files with 9 errors
- 20,633 pending cruise updates discovered across 17 cruise lines after initial fix
- Webhooks were working but batch processing was completely failing

#### The Root Cause
**Critical Issue**: `db.execute()` was returning arrays directly, not `{rows: []}` objects
- All code was accessing `result.rows` but should have been accessing `result` directly
- This was preventing batch sync from detecting pending cruises entirely
- Webhooks were working because they used different query patterns

#### The Fix Applied
```typescript
// OLD (broken) - accessing .rows on direct array
const result = await db.execute(sql`SELECT * FROM cruises`);
const cruises = result.rows; // ❌ undefined, result is already the array

// NEW (fixed) - accessing array directly  
const result = await db.execute(sql`SELECT * FROM cruises`);
const cruises = result; // ✅ correct, result is the array
```

**Files Modified**:
- All database queries in batch sync services
- Price sync validation queries
- Lock management queries
- Cruise count and status queries

### 2. V3 Batch Sync Service Implementation

#### New Service Architecture
**File Created**: `/backend/src/services/price-sync-batch-v3.service.ts`

#### Key Features Implemented:
- **Concurrency Control**: Prevents overlapping sync operations using `sync_locks` table
- **Throttling**: Processes max 3 cruise lines per 5-minute cron run (instead of 31 at once)
- **Per-line Limits**: Maximum 5000 cruises per cruise line to prevent timeouts
- **Progress Tracking**: Detailed tracking of processed/successful/failed updates
- **Lock Protection**: Prevents multiple workers from processing same cruise line
- **Self-healing**: Automatically handles stuck or failed locks
- **Enhanced Logging**: Comprehensive error tracking and Slack notifications

#### Concurrency Control Features:
```typescript
// Lock acquisition with safety checks
const lockId = await this.acquireLock(lineId);
if (!lockId) {
  logger.warn(`Could not acquire lock for line ${lineId}, skipping`);
  continue;
}

// Process with lock protection
const lineResult = await this.syncCruiseLinePrices(lineId, lockId);

// Always release lock with proper status
await this.releaseLock(lockId, 'completed');
```

### 3. Database Migration and Lock Management

#### sync_locks Table Creation
**Purpose**: Prevent concurrent processing of same cruise lines
**Schema**:
```sql
CREATE TABLE sync_locks (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  cruise_line_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
  lock_type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  locked_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  locked_by VARCHAR(255),
  status VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'processing',
  total_cruises INTEGER,
  processed_cruises INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  successful_updates INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  failed_updates INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  error_message TEXT,
  completed_at TIMESTAMP,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

#### Constraint Resolution
**File Created**: `/backend/src/scripts/fix-sync-locks-constraint.js`

**Problem**: Initial UNIQUE constraint was too restrictive
- Constraint: `UNIQUE (cruise_line_id, lock_type, status)` 
- Issue: Prevented multiple completed locks per cruise line

**Solution**: Partial unique index instead of full constraint
```sql
-- Dropped problematic constraint
ALTER TABLE sync_locks DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS unique_active_lock;

-- Created partial index - only restricts processing locks
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_unique_processing_lock 
ON sync_locks (cruise_line_id, lock_type) 
WHERE status = 'processing';
```

#### Lock Cleanup Automation
**File Created**: `/backend/src/scripts/cleanup-stuck-locks.js`

**Features**:
- Finds processing locks older than 10 minutes
- Marks stuck locks as 'failed' automatically
- Prevents indefinite lock blocking
- Provides manual cleanup options

### 4. Enhanced Error Handling and Monitoring

#### Comprehensive Error Logging
```typescript
logger.error(`❌ Failed to download/parse ${filePath}:`, {
  error: err instanceof Error ? err.message : err,
  fileName: file.name,
  codetocruiseid
});
```

#### Slack Integration for Real-time Monitoring
```typescript
await slackService.notifyCustomMessage({
  title: '🔄 Starting batch price sync V3',
  message: `Processing ${linesToProcess.length} cruise lines (${result.skippedLines} deferred)`,
  details: {
    cruiseLines: linesToProcess,
    workerId: this.workerId,
    maxPerRun: this.MAX_LINES_PER_RUN
  }
});
```

#### Structured Result Tracking
```typescript
interface SyncResult {
  filesFound: number;
  filesProcessed: number;
  cruisesUpdated: number;
  cruisesNotFound: number;
  errors: number;
  duration: number;
  skippedLines?: number;
}
```

### 5. Webhook and Batch Processing Integration

#### Current Architecture Flow:
1. **Webhooks receive price updates** from external API
2. **Large updates (>100 cruises)** are deferred to batch processing
3. **Cruises marked** with `needs_price_update = true`
4. **V3 batch service** processes in controlled batches with locks
5. **System is self-healing** but currently bottlenecked at final step

#### Throttling Strategy:
- **Every 5 minutes**: Cron job runs V3 batch sync
- **Max 3 cruise lines** processed per run (instead of 31)
- **Remaining lines** deferred to next cron cycle
- **Safety limit**: 5000 cruises per cruise line maximum

### 6. Current System Status

#### Processing Statistics:
- **Total pending updates**: 20,633 cruise updates across 17 cruise lines
- **Cron job frequency**: Every 5 minutes
- **Lines found**: 31 cruise lines with pending updates
- **Lines processed per run**: 3 (28 deferred)
- **FTP files found**: 9 files detected
- **Current bottleneck**: 22 errors during file processing

#### Error Patterns Identified:
```
Files found: 9
Files processed: 9
Errors: 22 (more errors than files indicates compound issues)
```

**Analysis**: Errors outnumber files, suggesting multiple failures per file:
- JSON parsing errors
- FTP download timeouts
- Database connection issues during processing
- File format inconsistencies

## Technical Issues Resolved

### Database Query Bug
- **Issue**: `db.execute()` returning arrays directly, not `{rows: []}` objects
- **Impact**: Complete failure of batch sync cruise detection
- **Solution**: Changed all `result.rows` to `result` in database queries
- **Files affected**: All batch sync services and query functions

### Concurrency Conflicts
- **Issue**: Multiple workers trying to process same cruise lines simultaneously
- **Impact**: Lock conflicts, duplicate processing, resource contention
- **Solution**: Implemented sync_locks table with proper constraints
- **Result**: Only one worker can process a cruise line at a time

### Database Constraint Issues
- **Issue**: UNIQUE constraint too restrictive, preventing multiple completed locks
- **Impact**: ON CONFLICT errors during lock release
- **Solution**: Replaced constraint with partial index for processing status only
- **Result**: Multiple completed locks allowed, processing locks still unique

### Timeout and Resource Issues
- **Issue**: Trying to process 31 cruise lines simultaneously causing timeouts
- **Impact**: Cron jobs failing, workers crashing, resource exhaustion
- **Solution**: Limited to 3 lines per run with proper queue management
- **Result**: Stable processing with predictable resource usage

## Current Challenges and Next Steps

### 1. FTP File Processing Errors
**Status**: 9 files found, 22 errors during processing
**Potential Causes**:
- Network timeouts during large file downloads
- JSON parsing errors in cruise data files
- Encoding issues with file content
- Connection pool exhaustion

**Investigation Needed**:
- Enhanced error logging for specific failure types
- Individual file validation before processing
- Retry mechanisms for transient failures
- Connection pool monitoring

### 2. Processing Bottleneck
**Current**: System finds pending updates but struggles with final processing
**Need**: 
- More detailed error categorization
- Retry logic for failed downloads
- Better handling of malformed data files
- Parallel processing within cruise lines

### 3. Scale Optimization
**Current**: Processing 3 lines every 5 minutes = ~36 lines per hour
**Need**: 
- Dynamic scaling based on update volume
- Priority processing for high-volume lines
- Intelligent batching strategies

                Small batch → Direct processing → Update prices
```

### Batch Processing Flow:
```
Cron (every 5min) → V3 Service → Check available lines → Acquire locks (max 3)
                                                        ↓
Process FTP files → Update database → Release locks → Slack notification
```

### Lock Management:
```
sync_locks table → Partial unique index → Only processing locks unique
                ↓                        ↓
          Track progress              Allow multiple completed
```
