# 2025-01-06: Cruise Detail Page Fixes and Last Minute Deals API Error Resolution

## Session Summary
Fixed critical display issues on cruise detail pages where cabin images weren't showing and itinerary was displaying "at sea" for all days. Also resolved 500 errors on the homepage last minute deals API due to incorrect SQL column names.

## Key Issues Addressed

### 1. Cruise Detail Page Data Extraction Problems
**Problem**: The cruise detail page (e.g., https://www.zipsea.com/cruise/star-of-the-seas-2026-01-25-2111828) showed:
- No cabin images
- All itinerary days showing "at sea" 
- Missing port names and descriptions

**Root Cause**: The extraction functions in `cruise-rawdata-extractor.ts` were looking for incorrect field names in the raw_data JSON stored in the database. The data was present but not being extracted properly.

**Solution**: Updated extraction logic to handle multiple field name variations:
```typescript
// For itinerary - check multiple possible field names
const portName = day.name || day.itineraryname || day.portname || day.port?.name || 'At Sea';

// For cabins - handle both array and object formats
if (Array.isArray(rawData.cabins)) {
  cabinArray = rawData.cabins;
} else if (typeof rawData.cabins === 'object') {
  cabinArray = Object.values(rawData.cabins);
}
```

### 2. Render Deployment Build Cache Issue
**Problem**: After fixing the extraction code and deploying, the changes weren't taking effect on production. The deployment showed as "live" but the TypeScript wasn't being recompiled.

**Root Cause**: Render was using cached build artifacts and not recompiling the TypeScript files.

**Solution**: Force a rebuild by adding a dummy commit. This is a known issue with Render where sometimes the build cache needs to be invalidated.

### 3. UI Improvements on Cruise Detail Page
Implemented multiple UI enhancements per user request:
- Removed voyage code block display
- Removed arrival/departure times from itinerary dropdown sections
- Disabled "Get Quote" buttons when price is unavailable (showing gray disabled state)
- Removed dropdown arrows for "at sea" days without descriptions

### 4. Last Minute Deals API 500 Error
**Problem**: Homepage was failing to load last minute deals with a 500 error: "column c.embark_port_id does not exist"

**Root Cause**: SQL queries in `getLastMinuteDeals` method were using incorrect column name `embark_port_id` instead of `embarkation_port_id`.

**Solution**: Fixed all three SQL queries in the method:
```sql
-- Before
LEFT JOIN ports ep ON c.embark_port_id = ep.id

-- After  
LEFT JOIN ports ep ON c.embarkation_port_id = ep.id
```

## Smart Resume Functionality Investigation
Explored the smart resume sync functionality which tracks sync progress and can resume from the last successful point. Key findings:
- `sync-smart-resume.js` uses Redis to track progress
- `sync-db-aware.js` checks existing database records before syncing
- Both scripts ultimately call the enhanced sync functions
- User opted to use direct sync command: `SYNC_YEAR=2026 SYNC_MONTH=06 node scripts/sync-complete-enhanced.js`

## Technical Learnings

### 1. Data Structure Flexibility
The raw data from Traveltek FTP can have varying field names and structures. Extraction functions must be defensive and check multiple possible field names/formats.

### 2. Build Cache Invalidation
When TypeScript changes aren't reflected after deployment on Render:
- Check the build logs to ensure TypeScript compilation ran
- May need to force a cache invalidation with a dummy commit
- Consider adding a build timestamp or version file to force rebuilds

### 3. SQL Column Consistency
Database column naming inconsistencies can cause runtime errors that aren't caught during build:
- `embarkation_port_id` vs `embark_port_id` 
- Important to maintain consistent naming conventions across schema and queries
- TypeScript/Drizzle ORM can help catch these at compile time if used consistently

### 4. Extraction vs Syncing
When data appears missing, distinguish between:
- **Sync issues**: Data not in database at all (requires re-sync)
- **Extraction issues**: Data in raw_data field but not extracted properly (just needs extraction fix)

In this case, the data was present but extraction was failing - no re-sync needed.

## Files Modified
- `/backend/src/services/cruise-rawdata-extractor.ts` - Fixed field name extraction logic
- `/frontend/app/cruise/[slug]/page.tsx` - UI improvements and button state handling
- `/backend/src/controllers/cruise.controller.ts` - Fixed SQL column names in last minute deals queries

## Deployment Notes
- Main branch auto-deploys to staging on Render
- Production branch requires manual deployment trigger
- TypeScript must be compiled before deployment (`npm run build`)
- Watch for build cache issues that may require forced invalidation

## Next Steps
- Monitor production deployment to ensure last minute deals are loading
- Consider adding integration tests for data extraction functions
- May want to add build versioning to prevent cache issues
- Document field name variations from Traveltek for future reference
