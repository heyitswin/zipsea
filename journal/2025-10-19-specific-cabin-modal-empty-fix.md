# Specific Cabin Modal Returns Empty - Investigation & Fix

**Date:** 2025-10-19  
**Issue:** When clicking "Choose Specific Cabin" button, the modal opens but shows "No specific cabins available"

## Timeline of Investigation

### Session 1: Initial Investigation
1. **Problem:** Modal showing no cabins despite cabins being available on RCC/Cruising Power websites
2. **Investigation:** Added enhanced logging to capture Traveltek API errors/warnings arrays
3. **Root Cause #1 Found:** Traveltek error 711: "You must specify a selectedgrade."
4. **Fix #1:** Added `selectedgrade: params.gradeno` parameter to getCabins API call
   - File: `backend/src/services/traveltek-api.service.ts:447`
   - Commit: `abc34a4`

### Session 2: Deployment Issues
1. **Problem:** Fix was deployed to staging backend, but user was testing on staging frontend which connects to **production backend**
2. **Production logs at 14:23:09** still showed error 711
3. **Action:** Merged fix to production branch
   - Encountered merge conflicts in `traveltek-api.service.ts`
   - Resolved conflicts keeping the selectedgrade fix
4. **New Problem:** Merge created duplicate function implementations:
   - `getSpecificCabins` duplicated in `booking.controller.ts` (lines 197 & 263)
   - `getSpecificCabins` duplicated in `traveltek-booking.service.ts` (lines 279 & 361)
5. **Fix #2:** Removed duplicate function implementations
   - Commit: `fd197b0`
6. **User Request:** Revert frontend changes from production (only keep backend fixes for testing)
7. **Fix #3:** Reverted frontend changes from production
   - Removed: `frontend/app/components/SpecificCabinModal.tsx`
   - Reverted: `frontend/app/cruise/[slug]/CruiseDetailClient.tsx`
   - Reverted: `frontend/middleware.ts`
   - Commit: `3346adf`

### Session 2 Continued: Root Cause #2 Found

**Problem:** After deployment, user still sees `rateCode: ''` (empty string) in console logs

**Deep Investigation:**

1. **Checked Production Logs (14:33:31):** Found cabin pricing response structure
2. **Key Discovery:** Traveltek returns a `gridpricing` array for each cabin grade with multiple pricing options:

```json
{
  "gradeno": "201:CU286197:0",
  "farecode": "CU286197",
  "gridpricing": [
    {
      "gradeno": "201:CU286197:0",
      "ratecode": "CU286197",
      "price": 3006.56,
      "available": "Y"
    },
    {
      "gradeno": "201:CU286197:1",
      "ratecode": "CJ923869",
      "price": 3538.56,
      "available": "Y"
    },
    {
      "gradeno": "201:CU286197:2",
      "ratecode": "HC363807",
      "price": 3538.56,
      "available": "Y"
    }
  ]
}
```

3. **Root Cause #2:** 
   - Backend only extracts TOP-LEVEL `gradeno` and `ratecode` from cabin
   - Frontend displays MULTIPLE pricing options from `gridpricing` array
   - When user clicks option `:2`, frontend passes `gradeNo: '201:CU286197:2'` but `rateCode: ''` because we never extracted ratecodes from gridpricing array elements
   - Backend then sends `"ratecode": ""` to Traveltek getCabins API (logged at 14:33:35.491975615)
   - Traveltek returns 0 cabins because ratecode is required

## The Real Problem

**Backend is correct** - it returns all data including the full `gridpricing` array in the raw cabin response.

**Frontend bug** - it's not extracting the `ratecode` from individual `gridpricing` array elements. The frontend needs to:
1. Parse the `gridpricing` array from each cabin
2. Extract each pricing option's `gradeno` AND `ratecode`  
3. Store both values together
4. Pass the correct `ratecode` when user selects a specific pricing option

## Commits Applied

### Main Branch (Staging)
- `abc34a4` - Fix: Add required 'selectedgrade' parameter to getCabins API call
- `f40b914` - Add enhanced logging to Traveltek API getCabinGrades and getCabins

### Production Branch
- `f0d35a0` - Merge main to production: Add selectedgrade parameter fix for getCabins
- `fd197b0` - Fix: Remove duplicate function implementations from merge conflict
- `3346adf` - Revert frontend changes - keep only backend fixes for testing

## Next Steps

**Frontend Fix Required:**
1. Update cabin pricing mapping to extract ratecode from `gridpricing` array elements
2. Store ratecode alongside gradeno for each pricing option
3. Pass correct ratecode when user clicks "Choose Specific Cabin"

**Files to Update:**
- `frontend/app/cruise/[slug]/CruiseDetailClient.tsx` - Update cabin data structure to include ratecode from gridpricing
- May need to update the pricing display logic to properly map gridpricing array

## Technical Notes

### Traveltek API Structure
- **getCabinGrades** returns cabin grades with `gridpricing` array
- Each `gridpricing` element represents a different rate/pricing option
- The `gradeno` suffix (`:0`, `:1`, `:2`) indicates the pricing option index
- **getCabins** requires BOTH `gradeno` AND `ratecode` to fetch specific cabins
- If `ratecode` is empty, getCabins returns 0 results

### Current Backend Behavior
- ✅ Successfully adds `selectedgrade` parameter
- ✅ Returns full cabin data including `gridpricing` array
- ✅ Logs all Traveltek errors/warnings
- ❌ Frontend doesn't extract ratecode from gridpricing elements

### Deployment Strategy
- Backend fixes deployed to both staging and production
- Frontend changes reverted from production (still in staging/main branch)
- Frontend fix needed before deploying to production
