# January 8, 2025 - Webhook Processing & Search API Fixes

## Session Summary
This session focused on resolving critical production issues with webhook processing and cruise search functionality. The main branch serves as staging and production branch is deployed to production on Render.

## Critical Issues Resolved

### 1. Missing Available Dates API Endpoint (400 Error)
**Problem:** Cruise search was completely broken - searches returned no results despite data existing in database.
- Frontend was calling `/api/v1/cruises/available-dates?shipId=X` 
- Endpoint didn't exist in backend, causing 400 errors
- Example: Royal Caribbean Quantum of the Seas (Feb 10, 2026) showing no results

**Solution:** Created the missing endpoint in `backend/src/routes/cruise.routes.ts`:
```typescript
router.get('/available-dates', async (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  const shipId = parseInt(req.query.shipId as string);
  const result = await db.execute(sql`
    SELECT DISTINCT
      c.id, c.cruise_id, c.name, c.sailing_date, c.nights,
      ep.name as embark_port_name,
      dp.name as disembark_port_name,
      MIN(CAST(p.price AS DECIMAL)) as min_price
    FROM cruises c
    LEFT JOIN pricing p ON c.id = p.cruise_id
    LEFT JOIN ports ep ON c.embarkation_port_id = ep.id
    LEFT JOIN ports dp ON c.disembarkation_port_id = dp.id
    WHERE c.ship_id = ${shipId}
      AND c.sailing_date >= CURRENT_DATE
      AND c.is_active = true
    GROUP BY c.id, c.cruise_id, c.name, c.sailing_date, c.nights, ep.name, dp.name
    ORDER BY c.sailing_date ASC
  `);
  return res.json({ shipId, dates: result.rows || [], count: result.rows?.length || 0 });
});
```

**Key Fixes Applied:**
- Fixed import path: `../config/database` → `../db/connection`
- Fixed table name: `cruise_pricing` → `pricing`
- Fixed column names: `duration_nights` → `nights`
- Added proper JOINs for port names
- Removed non-existent `deleted_at` column check

### 2. Webhook Processing Still Limited to 500 Cruises
**Problem:** Despite creating ComprehensiveWebhookService, production was still using the old EnhancedWebhookService with 500 cruise limit.
- Logs showed: "Limiting to 500 cruises to prevent overload (total: 562)"
- Large cruise lines were only partially updated

**Solution:** Updated webhook route to use comprehensive service:
```typescript
// backend/src/routes/webhook.routes.ts
// Changed from:
enhancedWebhookService.processWebhook(payload.lineid)
// To:
comprehensiveWebhookService.processWebhook(payload.lineid)
```

### 3. Obsolete Cron Job Running Every 5 Minutes
**Problem:** The `price-sync-production` cron job was still running every 5 minutes, checking for flags.
- This was legacy behavior from when webhooks set flags instead of updating directly
- Unnecessary load on system

**Solution:** Confirmed cron job is no longer needed and can be suspended since:
- ComprehensiveWebhookService updates database directly
- No longer uses flag-based processing
- Webhook handles all updates in real-time

### 4. Complex Webhook Monitoring
**Problem:** Monitoring webhooks required multiple complex commands and Slack messages were outdated.

**Solution:** Created simple `webhook-status.sh` monitoring script that shows:
- System health (FTP/Redis status)
- Active webhook processing
- Recent updates
- Common cruise line IDs for testing

## Current Architecture

### Webhook Processing Flow
1. Webhook received at `/api/webhooks/traveltek/cruiseline-pricing-updated`
2. ComprehensiveWebhookService processes ALL cruises for the line (no 500 limit)
3. Uses batch processing (100 cruises per batch)
4. FTP connection pooling (3 connections)
5. Retry logic for corrupted JSON (3 attempts)
6. Direct database updates (no flags)
7. Redis locks prevent concurrent processing

### Key Services
- **ComprehensiveWebhookService**: Handles ALL cruises without limits
- **FTP Connection Pooling**: Manages 3 concurrent connections
- **Batch Processing**: 100 files per batch for efficiency
- **Redis Locking**: Prevents duplicate processing

## Ongoing Issues

### FTP Connection Errors
Latest webhook test shows FTP connection issues:
```
error: "User launched a task while another one is still running"
Failed to process cruise 337705 after 3 attempts
```
This appears to be an FTP connection pooling issue that needs investigation.

## Testing Results
- Crystal Cruises (Line ID 21): Webhook received successfully
- Response time: ~300ms for webhook acknowledgment
- Processing: Async, encountering FTP errors

## Deployment Notes
- Main branch → Staging environment
- Production branch → Production environment
- Both environments on Render
- Environment variables stored in Render dashboard

## Lessons Learned

1. **Always verify API endpoints exist** - The missing available-dates endpoint completely broke search functionality
2. **Check which service is actually being used** - ComprehensiveWebhookService was created but not wired up
3. **Review cron jobs after architecture changes** - Flag-based processing cron was still running despite direct updates
4. **Simple monitoring beats complex commands** - Single status script is more useful than multiple commands
5. **Test with small datasets first** - Crystal (5 cruises) is better for testing than Royal Caribbean (3,102 cruises)

## Next Steps
1. Investigate and fix FTP connection pooling errors
2. Consider implementing webhook retry queue for failed cruises
3. Add more robust error recovery for individual cruise failures
4. Monitor production search functionality after deployment
