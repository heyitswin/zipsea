# Major Debugging Session - August 21, 2025

## Overview
Today was a breakthrough day for the ZipSea backend infrastructure. After extensive debugging and performance analysis, we've successfully resolved critical issues that were preventing the API from returning search results and fixed major synchronization problems.

## 🔍 Today's Major Learnings

### Database Status Discovery
- **Production database contains 5,146 cruises** with 192,729 pricing records
- **4,322 are future cruises** (September 2025 onwards) - exactly what users need
- Database spans from January 2025 to January 2026, providing comprehensive coverage
- Data quality is good overall, but had specific issues with cruise line names

### Redis Performance Validation
- **Redis is working perfectly** with an impressive **82.5% cache hit rate**
- Caching layer is significantly improving API response times
- Cache warming strategies are effective
- TypeScript compilation issues with Redis were resolved

### Root Cause Analysis - API Empty Results
The API was returning empty results due to two critical issues:

#### a) Data Corruption Issue
- **Cruise line names stored as "[object Object]"** instead of actual cruise line names
- This was caused by a synchronization bug in the FTP data processing
- The issue affected search filtering by cruise lines
- **Resolution**: Fixed the cruise line name extraction logic in sync scripts

#### b) Performance Bottleneck
- **Drizzle ORM queries taking 48+ seconds** to execute
- Complex JOIN operations were causing database timeouts
- Search API was essentially unusable due to performance
- **Resolution**: Implemented hotfix using raw SQL queries for immediate relief

### Webhook Integration Discoveries
- **Webhook pricing was failing** due to incorrect data structure assumptions
- Initial implementation assumed 3-level structure: `rateCode -> cabinType -> cabinId`
- **Actual structure is 2-level**: `rateCode -> cabinId`
- This caused pricing updates to fail silently

## 🔧 Issues Fixed Today

### 1. Webhook Pricing Structure Fix
- Corrected webhook pricing sync to use proper 2-level structure
- Updated parsing logic to handle `rateCode -> cabinId` relationship
- Tested with sample webhook data to confirm functionality
- **Files affected**: `src/services/webhook.service.ts`

### 2. Redis TypeScript Compilation
- Resolved TypeScript compilation errors in Redis integration
- Fixed type definitions and import issues
- Ensured proper error handling for Redis connection failures
- **Files affected**: `src/cache/redis.ts`, `src/cache/cache-manager.ts`

### 3. Cruise Line Name Corruption
- Fixed cruise line names being stored as "[object Object]"
- Updated FTP sync scripts to properly extract cruise line names
- Implemented proper object destructuring in data processing
- **Files affected**: `scripts/sync-simple-upsert.js`, `scripts/sync-sept-onwards.js`

### 4. Search Performance Hotfix
- Replaced slow Drizzle ORM queries with optimized raw SQL
- Reduced search response time from 48+ seconds to under 2 seconds
- Maintained all existing search functionality and filters
- **Files affected**: `src/services/search-hotfix.service.ts`

### 5. Sync Script Reliability
- Fixed both main sync scripts to handle edge cases properly
- Improved error handling and logging in sync operations
- Added proper validation for cruise line data extraction
- **Files affected**: `scripts/sync-simple-upsert.js`, `scripts/sync-sept-onwards.js`
