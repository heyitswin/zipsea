# 2025-10-28: Fixed Drizzle ORM Error - Added pricingBreakdown Column

## Problem
After deploying the code to store `pricingBreakdown` in sessions, users got "unable to reserve cabin" errors.

**Error**: 
```
TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'name')
    at PgDialect.buildUpdateSet
```

**Root Cause**: We added code to update `pricingBreakdown` field but forgot to add the column to the database first. Drizzle ORM couldn't build the UPDATE query because the column didn't exist.

## Solution

### 1. Created Migration (0015)
- File: `backend/src/db/migrations/0015_add_pricing_breakdown_to_sessions.sql`
- Added `pricing_breakdown JSONB` column to `booking_sessions` table
- Stores itemized breakdown from Traveltek's `cruisecabingradebreakdown.pl` API

### 2. Updated Schema
- File: `backend/src/db/schema/booking-sessions.ts`
- Added TypeScript definition for `pricingBreakdown` field with proper typing
- Format: Array of breakdown items with description, totalcost, category, etc.

### 3. Applied Migration
- Created migration script: `backend/scripts/run-pricing-breakdown-migration.js`
- Ran against production database successfully
- Verified column exists with correct JSONB type

## Deployment
- Commit: `2ec8073` (main), `67c05fd` (production)
- Migration applied to production database ✅
- Code deployed to production ✅
- Ready for testing

## Testing Required
User should now test the cabin reservation flow to verify:
1. Pricing breakdown is displayed on /booking step 1
2. Cabin can be reserved without errors
3. Breakdown data is persisted in session correctly
