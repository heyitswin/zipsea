# 2025-10-28: Fixed Pricing Breakdown Not Displaying - Session Retrieval Bug

## Problem
After successfully storing `pricingBreakdown` in the database, it still wasn't showing on the booking page.

**Symptoms**:
- Logs showed: `✅ Got pricing breakdown with 4 items` (fetching worked ✅)
- Logs showed: `pricingBreakdown available? true` (storing worked ✅)
- But log message `"Including pricing breakdown from session"` NEVER appeared ❌
- `cruisedetail.pricingbreakdown: undefined` in basket response

## Root Cause

The `getSession()` method in `traveltek-session.service.ts` was **not including the `pricingBreakdown` field** when reconstructing `SessionData` from the database (line 238-249).

Even though:
1. ✅ The column exists in the database (`pricing_breakdown JSONB`)
2. ✅ The field is defined in the `SessionData` interface
3. ✅ The `updateSession()` method correctly stores it to the database

The data was being saved but never retrieved!

## Solution

Added the missing field to session reconstruction in `getSession()`:

```typescript
const sessionData: SessionData = {
  sessionKey: dbSession.traveltekSessionKey,
  sid: dbSession.traveltekSid,
  expiresAt: dbSession.expiresAt,
  passengerCount: dbSession.passengerCount as PassengerCount,
  cruiseId: dbSession.cruiseId,
  userId: dbSession.userId || undefined,
  itemkey: dbSession.itemkey || undefined,
  cruiseResultNo: dbSession.selectedCabinGrade || undefined,
  isHoldBooking: dbSession.isHoldBooking || false,
  basketData: dbSession.basketData || undefined,
  pricingBreakdown: dbSession.pricingBreakdown || undefined, // ← ADDED THIS LINE
};
```

## Deployment
- Commit: `5fc40e0` (main), `08b9b88` (production)
- Deployed to production at ~16:22 ET
- Should now see pricing breakdown on /booking page

## Testing
User should test by:
1. Selecting a cabin on cruise detail page
2. Navigating to /booking page
3. Verifying pricing breakdown displays with itemized costs (cruise fare, taxes, NCF, etc.)

## Lesson Learned
When adding a new field to a database-backed session system:
1. ✅ Add column to database schema
2. ✅ Update TypeScript interface
3. ✅ Update storage logic (updateSession)
4. ✅ **Update retrieval logic (getSession)** ← We missed this step!

All parts must be updated or the data will be "write-only" and never retrieved.
