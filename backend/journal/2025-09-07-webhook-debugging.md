# Webhook and Slack Notification Debugging Session
**Date**: 2025-09-07
**Issue**: Webhook timeout errors and missing Slack notifications

## Initial Problems
1. Webhook timeout after sending test to line 22 (Royal Caribbean) - 499 status after 40 seconds
2. `/api/admin/pending-syncs` endpoint returning error about missing `price_update_requested_at` column
3. No Slack notifications being sent from enhanced webhook service

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Database Migration Issue ✅
- **Problem**: `price_update_requested_at` column existed in migration files but wasn't applied
- **Solution**: Created and ran `fix-missing-columns.js` script on production
- **Status**: Successfully fixed

### 2. Logger Configuration ✅
- **Problem**: Logger was only writing to files in production, not console output
- **Root Cause**: Cloud providers (Render) capture console output, not file output
- **Solution**: Modified `logger.ts` to output to console in all environments
- **Commit**: `6df668b` - Fix production logging - enable console output for cloud providers
- **Status**: Fixed and working

### 3. Webhook Timeout ✅
- **Problem**: Webhook was timing out after 40 seconds despite fast processing
- **Root Cause**: Console.log spam in `getWebhookLineId()` function blocking event loop
- **Solution**: 
  1. Removed console.log statements from FTP path mapping function
  2. Made webhook processing async (don't await)
- **Status**: Webhooks now respond immediately (< 20ms)

### 4. Enhanced Service Execution ✅
- **Problem**: Enhanced webhook service appeared to not be executing
- **Debugging Steps**:
  1. Added extensive console.log debugging throughout the service
  2. Verified service is being called properly
  3. Confirmed Redis lock acquisition is working
- **Status**: Service is executing but failing silently during bulk FTP download

## Remaining Issues

### 1. No Slack Notifications ❌
- Enhanced service starts execution successfully
- Acquires Redis lock properly
- Begins bulk FTP download for 500 cruises (limited from 3110 total)
- Appears to fail silently during or after download
- Never reaches Slack notification code
- No error messages in logs about notification attempts

### 2. PostgreSQL JSON Errors ⚠️
- Multiple JSON parsing errors in cache/search operations
- Error: "invalid input syntax for type json - Expected end of input, but found ','"
- Code: 22P02
- Affecting cache warming but not blocking operations

## Technical Details

### Webhook Flow (Working)
1. Webhook received at `/api/webhooks/traveltek/cruiseline-pricing-updated`
2. Handler executes immediately
3. Returns 200 response with webhook ID
4. Triggers async enhanced service processing

### Enhanced Service Flow (Partial)
1. ✅ Service method called
2. ✅ Checks if webhooks are paused (they're not)
3. ✅ Maps webhook line ID to database line ID
4. ✅ Acquires Redis lock for line-level processing
5. ✅ Starts bulk FTP download
6. ❌ Fails silently during download (processing 500 cruises)
7. ❌ Never reaches Slack notification code

### Key Commits
- `1e4689b` - Add journal entry documenting webhook and batch sync fixes
- `6df668b` - Fix production logging - enable console output
- `a4c5191` - Add console.log debug statements to webhook handlers
- `4ae62f8` - Add extensive console.log debugging to understand webhook flow
- `53d917e` - Add debug logging for Slack notifications
- `c769165` - Add extensive debug logging at start of enhanced webhook service
- `eb44430` - Add extensive Redis debugging in lock acquisition

## Next Steps
1. Add timeout handling for bulk FTP downloads
2. Add more granular error handling in download process
3. Check if processing 500 cruises causes memory/timeout issues
4. Verify Slack webhook URL configuration
5. Fix PostgreSQL JSON errors in cache layer
6. Consider reducing batch size from 500 cruises

## Lessons Learned
1. Cloud providers capture console output, not file logs - always configure loggers accordingly
2. Excessive console.log in hot paths can block Node.js event loop
3. Silent failures in async operations need defensive error handling
4. Redis connections should be verified early in service initialization
5. Lock acquisition is critical for preventing concurrent processing issues
