# Traveltek Integration Status Update

**Date**: December 20, 2024  
**Status**: ‚úÖ WEBHOOK FIXED, ‚è≥ FTP SYNC PENDING

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ‚úÖ Webhook Authentication Issue (FIXED)
**Problem**: Traveltek webhooks were getting 400 errors because our endpoint required signature validation  
**Solution**: Removed signature validation from `/api/webhooks/traveltek` endpoint  
**Result**: Webhooks now return 200 OK and are processed correctly

### 2. ‚è≥ FTP Data Sync (IN PROGRESS)
**Status**: FTP credentials are configured but data sync is not pulling files  
**Next Steps**: Check Render logs for specific FTP connection errors

## Current Webhook Status

```
‚úÖ Webhook endpoint: https://zipsea-production.onrender.com/api/webhooks/traveltek
‚úÖ Returns: 200 OK
‚úÖ Accepts: Traveltek webhook payloads without authentication
```

## Evidence from Logs

From your logs, we can see:
- Traveltek IPs (35.176.11.40, 99.81.160.227) were getting 400 errors
- User-Agent: "Mojolicious (Perl)" confirms these are from Traveltek
- After fix: Should now see 200 responses

## FTP Sync Investigation

The sync has been triggered multiple times but no data is appearing. Possible reasons:

### 1. Check FTP Connection in Logs
Look for these error messages in Render logs:
- "FTP connection error"
- "Failed to connect to Traveltek FTP"
- "Authentication failed"
- "530 Login authentication failed"

### 2. Verify Credentials Format
Ensure in Render environment:
- `TRAVELTEK_FTP_HOST` = `ftpeu1prod.traveltek.net` (no ftp:// prefix)
- `TRAVELTEK_FTP_USER` = [exact username from iSell]
- `TRAVELTEK_FTP_PASSWORD` = [exact password from iSell]

### 3. Possible FTP Issues
- **IP Whitelisting**: Render's IP might need to be whitelisted
- **Wrong Path**: Directory structure might be different
- **No Data**: There might be no cruise files for current period
- **Connection Blocked**: Firewall or network issue

## How to Monitor

### 1. Watch for Webhook Events
```bash
# Test if webhooks are working
curl -X POST https://zipsea-production.onrender.com/api/webhooks/traveltek \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"event": "cruiseline_pricing_updated", "lineid": 7}'
```

### 2. Check Render Logs
Go to Render Dashboard ‚Üí Logs ‚Üí Search for:
- `"Traveltek webhook received"` - Should see these when Traveltek sends real webhooks
- `"FTP"` - Will show FTP connection attempts
- `"Error"` or `"error"` - Any error messages

### 3. Monitor Data Population
```bash
# Check if any cruises appear
curl -X POST https://zipsea-production.onrender.com/api/v1/search \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"limit": 1}'
```

## Next Actions

### If FTP Still Fails:
1. **Contact Traveltek Support**:
   - "We're connecting to ftpeu1prod.traveltek.net but getting connection errors"
   - "Our service is hosted on Render.com - do we need IP whitelisting?"
   - "Can you confirm our credentials are active?"

2. **Get Render's Outbound IPs**:
   - Contact Render support for static IP addresses
   - Provide these to Traveltek for whitelisting

3. **Test Alternative Connection**:
   - Try with secure: true (FTPS)
   - Try different port (990 for implicit FTPS)

## Summary

- ‚úÖ **Webhooks**: Fixed and working - Traveltek can now send events
- ‚è≥ **FTP Sync**: Credentials configured but connection appears to be failing
- üìã **Next**: Check Render logs for specific FTP error messages

The webhook integration is complete. Once the FTP connection issue is resolved (likely needs IP whitelisting or credential verification), the full data pipeline will be operational.
