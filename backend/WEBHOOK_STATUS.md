## Webhook Endpoints Status

### Expected Webhook Payloads from Traveltek

#### 1. Cruise Line Pricing Updated
```json
{
  "event": "cruiseline_pricing_updated",
  "lineid": 7,
  "currency": "GBP",
  "marketid": 1,
  "timestamp": "2024-12-20T10:00:00Z",
  "description": "Royal Caribbean pricing updated"
}
```

#### 2. Live Pricing Updated
```json
{
  "event": "cruises_live_pricing_updated",
  "currency": "GBP",
  "marketid": 1,
  "timestamp": "2024-12-20T10:00:00Z",
  "paths": [
    "2025/05/7/231/8734921.json",
    "2025/05/7/231/8734922.json"
  ]
}
```

## Current Processing Status

### What's Working:
- ✅ Webhook endpoints are live and responding
- ✅ Endpoints return 200 OK (prevents Traveltek retries)
- ✅ Webhook events are logged in Render
- ✅ Basic payload validation

### What's Pending:
- ⏳ FTP credentials not configured (can't fetch data when webhook fires)
- ⏳ Database sync will fail without FTP access
- ⏳ Processing returns `success: false` but still responds 200 OK

## Monitoring Webhooks

### View Incoming Webhooks in Render Logs
1. Go to [Render Dashboard](https://dashboard.render.com)
2. Click on `zipsea-backend-production` service
3. Go to "Logs" tab
4. Filter for webhook events:
   - Search for `"Traveltek webhook received"`
   - Search for `"Cruiseline pricing updated"`
   - Search for `"Live pricing updated"`

### Test Webhooks Manually
```bash
# Test script available
node /Users/winlin/Desktop/sites/zipsea/backend/scripts/test-webhook.js

# Or test individual endpoints
curl -X POST https://zipsea-production.onrender.com/api/webhooks/traveltek/cruiseline-pricing-updated \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"lineid": 7, "timestamp": "2024-12-20T10:00:00Z"}'
```

## Next Steps

### 1. Configure FTP Credentials (Required)
Add to Render environment variables:
- `TRAVELTEK_FTP_HOST=ftpeu1prod.traveltek.net`
- `TRAVELTEK_FTP_USER=[Your Username]`
- `TRAVELTEK_FTP_PASSWORD=[Your Password]`

### 2. Monitor First Real Webhook
When Traveltek sends the first real webhook:
1. Check Render logs for incoming request
2. Verify payload structure matches expected format
3. Confirm 200 OK response is sent back

### 3. Verify Data Sync
Once FTP credentials are configured:
1. Webhook will trigger FTP download
2. Data will be processed and stored
3. Check database for imported cruise data

## Webhook Architecture

```
Traveltek → Webhook POST → Render Service → Process Event
                              ↓
                        Log & Return 200 OK
                              ↓
                    Queue Background Job (if FTP configured)
                              ↓
                        FTP Download & Sync
```

## Important Notes

1. **Always Returns 200 OK**: Even if processing fails, we return 200 to prevent Traveltek from retrying
2. **Async Processing**: Webhook immediately queues job and returns, actual processing happens in background
3. **No FTP = No Sync**: Without FTP credentials, webhooks are received but can't fetch the actual data
4. **Logging**: All webhook events are logged for debugging and monitoring

## Support

- **Traveltek Issues**: Contact your account manager
- **Render Issues**: Check service logs in dashboard
- **Application Issues**: Review logs for error messages

---

**Status Summary**: Webhooks are correctly registered with Traveltek and endpoints are operational. The system is ready to process webhook events as soon as FTP credentials are configured.
