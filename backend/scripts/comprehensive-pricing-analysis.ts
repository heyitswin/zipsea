- MAX_FILES_PER_LINE: 2000 files per cruise line

- Only processes first 50 files per ship
- MONTHS_TO_SYNC: 24 months (2 years ahead)

‚ö†Ô∏è  POTENTIAL GAPS:
1. If more than 5 cruise lines need updates, only first 5 are processed
2. Within each line, only first 3 ships per month are processed
3. Within each ship, only first 50 cruise files are processed
4. Remaining lines are skipped until next batch run

üîÑ FLAG CLEARING BEHAVIOR:
- ALL cruises for a processed cruise line get needs_price_update=false
- This happens even if not all files were processed due to limits
- This could leave some cruises without pricing data but with flags cleared

üî• CRITICAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED:
- ${criticalIssues.length} cruise lines have cruises without pricing but needs_price_update=false
- This suggests batch sync cleared flags without successfully processing all files
- Line 24 has ${line24WithoutPricing.length} cruises without pricing data

üîç ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:
1. Batch sync V5 has strict processing limits:
   - Only 5 cruise lines per run
   - Only first 3 ships per month
   - Only first 50 files per ship
2. After processing a cruise line, ALL flags are cleared regardless of completion
3. This creates a gap where some cruises never get processed

üí° RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. IMMEDIATE: Check FTP files for Line 24 cruises listed above
2. FIX: Modify batch sync to only clear flags for actually processed cruises
3. MONITOR: Set up alerts for cruises with no pricing after batch sync runs
4. SCALE: Consider increasing processing limits or running more frequently

üìã NEXT STEPS FOR FTP VERIFICATION:
1. Check the specific FTP file paths listed above for Line 24
2. Verify if the JSON files exist and contain pricing data
3. If files exist but pricing is missing, investigate the parsing logic
4. If files don't exist, investigate the FTP sync process

üéØ ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTIONS:

1. ‚ùì "Get a list of which specific cruises don't have pricing data"
   ‚úÖ FOUND: ${line24WithoutPricing.length} Line 24 cruises without pricing (see detailed list above)
   üìÅ All FTP file paths provided for manual verification

2. ‚ùì "Confirm that batch syncs continue until ALL marked cruises are synced"
   ‚ùå ISSUE FOUND: Batch sync has limits that prevent complete processing:
   - Only 5 cruise lines per run (MAX_LINES_PER_RUN = 5)
   - Only 3 ships per monthly directory 
   - Only 50 files per ship
   - Flags cleared for entire cruise line even if incomplete

üîß THE PROBLEM:
- Batch sync clears needs_price_update=false for ALL cruises in a line
- But only processes a subset due to limits (3 ships, 50 files each)
- This leaves cruises without pricing but with cleared flags
- They won't be picked up in subsequent runs

üìä EVIDENCE:
- ${criticalIssues.length} cruise lines have this pattern
- Line 24: ${line24WithoutPricing.length} cruises missing pricing, ${line24Analysis.filter(c => c.needs_price_update).length} flagged for update
