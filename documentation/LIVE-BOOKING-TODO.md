## Known Issues & Blockers

### Critical Issues
1. **Missing Authentication Middleware**
   - Status: Not implemented
   - Impact: Cannot protect user-specific booking routes
   - Resolution: Create auth middleware (optional auth for guest bookings)
   - Priority: Medium (not blocking - can do guest bookings first)

2. **Basket/Booking/Payment Not Implemented**
   - Status: Next phase of implementation
   - Impact: Cannot complete full booking flow yet
   - Resolution: Implement remaining booking orchestration methods
   - Priority: High

### Non-Critical Issues
1. **No Frontend Implementation Yet**
   - Status: Expected (backend-first approach)
   - Impact: Cannot test UI
   - Resolution: Implement after backend complete
   - Priority: Medium

---

## Technical Debt

- [ ] Add comprehensive error logging
- [ ] Add request/response logging (sanitized)
- [ ] Add performance monitoring
- [ ] Add database query optimization
- [ ] Add caching strategy for cabin grades
- [ ] Add webhook for booking confirmations
- [ ] Add automated testing suite
- [ ] Add load testing
- [ ] Add security audit
- [ ] Add accessibility audit (frontend)

---

## Future Enhancements

### Additional Features
- [ ] Support for more cruise lines (as Traveltek enables)
- [ ] Group bookings (multiple cabins)
- [ ] Add-ons (excursions, beverage packages, etc.)
- [ ] Price alerts for saved searches

- [ ] Optimize session storage
- [ ] Reduce API calls with intelligent caching
- [ ] Add GraphQL layer for frontend

---

## Notes & Decisions

### Architecture Decisions
- **Backend-first approach**: Implement and test backend before frontend
- **Session management**: 2-hour TTL matching Traveltek API
- **Payment handling**: PCI-compliant, card data goes directly to Traveltek
- **Error handling**: Graceful degradation, clear user messages
- **Testing strategy**: Use production Traveltek API with refundable bookings

### Business Decisions
- **Supported cruise lines**: Start with Royal Caribbean and Celebrity only
- **Feature flag**: Use `TRAVELTEK_LIVE_BOOKING_ENABLED` for gradual rollout
- **Manual quote fallback**: Keep existing quote system for non-supported lines
- **Pricing**: Show deposit amount and balance due date
- **Cancellation**: Users contact support, no self-service initially

### Technical Decisions
- **OAuth management**: Redis-cached tokens with auto-refresh
- **Session storage**: Redis with 2-hour TTL
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with JSONB for flexible booking data
- **Frontend framework**: Next.js (existing)
- **API architecture**: RESTful (consistent with existing)
- **Monitoring**: Sentry + Slack notifications
