## Notes & Decisions

### Architecture Decisions
- **Backend-first approach**: Implement and test backend before frontend
- **Session management**: 2-hour TTL matching Traveltek API
- **Payment handling**: PCI-compliant, card data goes directly to Traveltek
- **Error handling**: Graceful degradation, clear user messages
- **Testing strategy**: Use production Traveltek API with refundable bookings

### Business Decisions
- **Supported cruise lines**: Start with Royal Caribbean and Celebrity only
- **Feature flag**: Use `TRAVELTEK_LIVE_BOOKING_ENABLED` for gradual rollout
- **Manual quote fallback**: Keep existing quote system for non-supported lines
- **Pricing**: Show deposit amount and balance due date
- **Cancellation**: Users contact support, no self-service initially

### Technical Decisions
- **OAuth management**: Redis-cached tokens with auto-refresh
- **Session storage**: Redis with 2-hour TTL
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with JSONB for flexible booking data
- **Frontend framework**: Next.js (existing)
- **API architecture**: RESTful (consistent with existing)
- **Monitoring**: Sentry + Slack notifications
