# Zipsea Session Summary - January 11, 2025

## Overview
This session focused on critical fixes for the Zipsea platform including frontend authentication issues, search API problems, webhook processor memory optimization, admin dashboard fixes, and creating a comprehensive search endpoint.

## Key Issues Fixed

### 1. Frontend Authentication & Image Proxy Issues
**Problem:** Last minute deal images only showing for logged-in users
**Solution:** Added `/api/image-proxy` to public routes in Next.js middleware

**Files Modified:**
- `/frontend/middleware.ts` - Added image proxy to public routes

```typescript
const isPublicRoute = createRouteMatcher([
  "/api/image-proxy", // Allow public access to image proxy
  // ... other routes
]);
```

### 2. Search API Not Finding Cruises
**Problem:** Cruises in database not showing in search (e.g., Wonder of the Seas Feb 9, 2026)
**Solution:** Fixed API endpoint and response format parsing

**Files Modified:**
- `/frontend/lib/api.ts` - Changed endpoint from `/api/v1/cruises` to `/api/v1/search/by-ship`
- Fixed response parsing from `result.data.cruises` to `result.results`

### 3. PostgreSQL Memory Exhaustion During Sync
**Problem:** PostgreSQL page cache hitting 100% (3.7GB/4GB) during webhook processing
**Root Cause:** Aggressive batching and concurrency causing memory pressure

**Solution:** Scaled down webhook processor settings dramatically
- FTP batch size: 10 → 5
- Files per job: 100 → 50  
- Queue concurrency: 5 → 3
- DB connection pool: 50 → 15
- Added 1-second delay between batches

**Files Modified:**
- `/backend/src/services/webhook-processor-optimized-v2.service.ts`
- `/backend/src/config/environment.ts`

**Final Settings:**
```typescript
const FTP_BATCH_SIZE = 5; // Process 5 FTP files at a time
const BATCH_SIZE = 5; // Process 5 files per batch
const QUEUE_CONCURRENCY = 3; // Process 3 jobs concurrently
const FILES_PER_JOB = 50; // 50 files per job
```

### 4. Slack Completion Messages Not Sending
**Problem:** Only "started" messages appearing, no completion messages
**Solution:** Fixed race condition in batch completion tracking

**Files Modified:**
- `/backend/src/services/webhook-processor-optimized-v2.service.ts`
- Added check for last batch before sending completion

### 5. Combined Pricing Fields Not Stored
**Problem:** Combined pricing fields from Traveltek not being stored in raw_json
**Solution:** Updated pricing update logic to store combined structure

**Files Modified:**
- `/backend/src/services/webhook-processor-optimized-v2.service.ts`
- Now stores combined pricing in rawData field

### 6. Admin Quotes Table 500 Error
**Problem:** Admin quotes table throwing 500 error due to incorrect type casting
**Solution:** Removed incorrect `::text` casting in cruise_id join

**Files Modified:**
- `/backend/src/routes/admin.routes.ts`
- Changed `qr.cruise_id::text = c.id` to `qr.cruise_id = c.id`
- Made table wider using `min-w-full` class in `/frontend/app/admin/AdminQuotes.tsx`

### 7. Comprehensive Search Endpoint
**Created:** New comprehensive search endpoint with full filtering capabilities

**New Files:**
- `/backend/src/services/search-comprehensive.service.ts`
- `/backend/src/controllers/search-comprehensive.controller.ts`
- `/backend/src/routes/search-comprehensive.routes.ts`

**Features:**
- Search by cruise line, ship, departure month, region, port
- Price range filtering
- Nights range filtering  
- Cabin type filtering
- Sorting by date, price, nights, popularity
- Search facets/filters with counts
- Caching with 5-minute TTL
- Performance optimized with proper indexing

**Endpoint:** `GET /api/v1/search/comprehensive`

**Query Parameters:**
- `q` - General search query
- `departureMonth` - Filter by month (YYYY-MM)
- `startDate`/`endDate` - Date range filters
- `cruiseLineId` - Filter by cruise line(s)
- `shipId` - Filter by ship(s)
- `departurePortId`/`arrivalPortId` - Port filters
- `regionId` - Filter by region(s)
- `nights`/`minNights`/`maxNights` - Nights filters
- `minPrice`/`maxPrice` - Price range
- `cabinType` - Cabin type filter
- `sortBy` - Sort by date/price/nights/popularity
- `includeFacets` - Include search facets

## Key Learnings

### PostgreSQL Page Cache Management
- Page cache is PostgreSQL's buffer for frequently accessed data
- High page cache usage (>90%) causes severe performance degradation
- Memory pressure causes disk I/O spikes and slow queries
- Solution: Reduce batch sizes, concurrency, and connection pool size

### Render.com Metrics
- Monitor memory usage closely during batch operations
- PostgreSQL Standard instance has 4GB RAM limit
- Page cache doesn't automatically clear - requires time between batches
- CPU usage less critical than memory for database operations

### Database Schema Insights
- `cruises.id` is VARCHAR (codetocruiseid from Traveltek)
- `cruises.cruiseId` is the original ID that can duplicate
- Region/port IDs stored as comma-separated strings
- Combined pricing structure contains most reliable price data

### Performance Optimizations
- Use raw SQL for complex searches (better than ORM)
- Cache search results with short TTL (5 minutes)
- Batch tool calls for parallel execution
- Add delays between batches to allow cache clearing

## Critical Files to Remember

### Backend Core Files
- `/backend/src/services/webhook-processor-optimized-v2.service.ts` - Main webhook processor
- `/backend/src/services/search-comprehensive.service.ts` - Comprehensive search logic
- `/backend/src/db/schema/cruises.ts` - Cruise table schema
- `/backend/src/config/environment.ts` - Database connection settings

### Frontend Core Files  
- `/frontend/middleware.ts` - Authentication middleware
- `/frontend/lib/api.ts` - API client functions
- `/frontend/app/cruise/[slug]/page.tsx` - Cruise detail page
- `/frontend/app/admin/AdminQuotes.tsx` - Admin quotes interface

## Database Column Names (British Spelling)
- `colour_code` (not color_code)
- `embark_port_id` (not embarkation_port_id in code)
- `disembark_port_id` (not disembarkation_port_id in code)

## Things to Monitor
1. PostgreSQL page cache percentage during syncs
2. Memory usage on database instance
3. Webhook processing completion messages in Slack
4. Search API response times (>1s indicates issues)
5. Admin dashboard functionality

## Deployment Notes
- All changes deployed to production branch
- Backend builds successfully with TypeScript
- Frontend middleware changes require careful testing
- Database connection pool settings critical for stability

## Future Improvements Needed
1. Implement database query result streaming for large datasets
2. Add Redis caching when available
3. Consider database upgrade if memory issues persist
4. Add monitoring alerts for page cache threshold
5. Implement progressive loading for search results
6. Add database indexes for region_ids and port_ids columns
