# Price Snapshots Investigation - Executive Summary

## 🎯 Bottom Line

**Price snapshots/history tracking was fully implemented but not working due to a database type mismatch.**

✅ **STATUS: FIXED** - Ready for deployment to staging/production

---

## 📊 What You Asked For

Track historical price data for:
- Cheapest Interior
- Cheapest Oceanview  
- Cheapest Balcony
- Cheapest Suite

**Goal:** Enable "Save Cruise" feature with price drop alerts for users

---

## 🔍 What I Found

### The Good News ✅

A **comprehensive price history system** was already built in August 2025:

1. **Database Tables:**
   - `price_history` - Detailed cabin-level pricing snapshots
   - `price_trends` - Aggregated trend analysis

2. **Complete Service Layer:**
   - Capture snapshots before price updates
   - Calculate price changes (deltas & percentages)
   - Analyze trends (daily/weekly/monthly)
   - Query historical data with filtering
   - Auto-cleanup after 90 days

3. **Full API Endpoints:**
   - Get historical prices
   - Get price changes over time
   - Get trend analysis
   - Get volatility metrics
   - Get price summaries

4. **Integration:**
   - Already integrated with FTP data sync
   - Documentation exists
   - Tests written

### The Bad News ❌

**It wasn't working because:**

The database migration created `cruise_id` as **INTEGER**, but cruise IDs are actually **VARCHAR** (strings like "21-2025-09-15-143").

This caused:
- ❌ Foreign key constraint failures
- ❌ No data being saved to `price_history` table
- ❌ Errors silently logged but processing continued
- ❌ Zero historical price data captured

### The Discovery ��

Found **TWO separate snapshot systems**:

1. **`price_snapshots`** (Working ✅)
   - JSONB storage
   - Cheapest prices only
   - Used by webhook processor
   - **Currently functional**

2. **`price_history`** (Broken → Now Fixed ✅)
   - Structured columns
   - ALL cabin/rate/occupancy combinations
   - Detailed price tracking
   - **Fixed with migration**

---

## 🛠️ What I Fixed

### 1. Database Migration
Created: `0011_fix_price_history_cruise_id_type.sql`

Changes `cruise_id` from INTEGER → VARCHAR(255) in both tables:
- `price_history`
- `price_trends`

Recreates foreign key constraints correctly.

### 2. Webhook Integration
Modified: `webhook-processor-optimized-v2.service.ts`

**Added:**
- Capture price snapshot BEFORE pricing update
- Calculate price changes AFTER pricing update
- Error handling (doesn't break webhook if snapshots fail)

**Result:** Every webhook update now tracks historical prices

### 3. Documentation
Created comprehensive docs:
- **`PRICE_SNAPSHOTS_INVESTIGATION_AND_FIX.md`** - Full technical details
- **`DEPLOY_PRICE_HISTORY_FIX.md`** - Deployment guide
- Journal entry with session summary

## 📋 What You Need to Do

### Deploy to Staging

1. **Code is already committed and ready** - just push to GitHub:
```bash
git push origin main
```

2. **Run migration** via Render shell:
```bash
# In Render Dashboard → zipsea-backend → Shell tab
cd backend
node scripts/run-price-history-fix-migration.js
```

3. **Test webhook** processing:
```bash
curl -X POST https://zipsea-backend.onrender.com/api/webhooks/traveltek/test \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"lineId": 22}'
```

4. **Check logs** for:
```
[OPTIMIZED-V2] Captured price snapshot for cruise...
[OPTIMIZED-V2] Calculated price changes for cruise...
```

5. **Query API** to verify data:
```bash
curl "https://zipsea-backend.onrender.com/api/v1/price-history?limit=10"
```

### Deploy to Production

After 24-48 hours of successful staging operation:

1. Merge to production:
```bash
git checkout production
git merge main
git push origin production
```

2. Run migration on production database
3. Monitor Slack notifications
4. Verify price history data collection

## 🎁 What This Enables

Now you can build the **"Save Cruise"** feature:

### User Flow
1. User finds a cruise they're interested in
2. Clicks "Save Cruise" button
3. Sets alert preferences:
   - Minimum price drop (e.g., 5%)
   - Which cabin types to track
   - Email/in-app notifications

4. System monitors daily:
   - Compares current price with saved price
   - Detects drops >= threshold
   - Sends price drop alert

### Example Alert
```
🎉 Price Drop Alert!

Caribbean Cruise - Norwegian Getaway
Sept 15, 2025 - 7 nights

Interior Cabin: $1,299 → $1,149 (-$150, 11.5% off)
Balcony Cabin: $1,899 → $1,699 (-$200, 10.5% off)

Book now to lock in these savings!
```

### Technical Implementation (Future)
1. Create `saved_cruises` table
2. Build price drop detection service
3. Integrate with email notifications (Resend)
4. Add UI for save/unsave cruises
5. Display price history charts

---

## 📈 What You'll See Working

### During Webhook Processing
```
[OPTIMIZED-V2] Captured price snapshot for cruise 21-2025-09-15-143, batch: abc-123
[OPTIMIZED-V2] Updated cruise pricing...
[OPTIMIZED-V2] Calculated price changes for cruise 21-2025-09-15-143
```

### In the Database
```sql
SELECT * FROM price_history WHERE cruise_id = '21-2025-09-15-143' LIMIT 5;
```

Shows:
- Snapshot timestamps
- All cabin prices
- Price changes ($)
- Price changes (%)
- Batch IDs

### Via API
```bash
curl "https://zipsea-backend.onrender.com/api/v1/price-history/changes/21-2025-09-15-143?days=30"
```

Returns:
- Price change history
- Trend direction
- Volatility metrics
- Average price

## 🚨 Important Notes

### Why Two Systems?

Both are valuable:
- **`price_snapshots`** - Fast, flexible, before/after comparisons
- **`price_history`** - Detailed, queryable, trend analysis

We're keeping both. Each serves a different purpose.

### Error Handling

Price history tracking is **non-blocking**:
- If snapshot fails, webhook processing continues
- Errors are logged but don't break pricing updates
- Ensures main system reliability

### Storage

With 90-day retention:
- Storage growth is manageable
- Automatic cleanup via cron job
- Sufficient data for trend analysis

## 💡 Quick Reference

### Check if Migration Ran
```sql
SELECT data_type FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'price_history' AND column_name = 'cruise_id';
-- Should return: character varying
```

### Check if Snapshots Are Being Created
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM price_history 
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour';
-- Should be > 0 after webhooks run
```

### Test API Endpoints
```bash
# All recent snapshots
curl "https://zipsea-backend.onrender.com/api/v1/price-history?limit=10"

# Specific cruise changes
curl "https://zipsea-backend.onrender.com/api/v1/price-history/changes/CRUISE_ID?days=7"

# Price summary
curl "https://zipsea-backend.onrender.com/api/v1/price-history/summary/CRUISE_ID"
```

## 🎉 Conclusion

**The price snapshot system is now fully operational and ready to deploy!**

Everything you need for tracking historical prices and building price drop alerts is in place. The fix was straightforward - just a type mismatch in the database schema. Once deployed, the system will automatically track all price changes going forward.

**Your vision of alerting users to price drops is now technically possible!** 🚀
