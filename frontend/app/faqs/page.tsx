const faqs: FAQ[] = [
  {
    id: 1,
    question: "What is onboard credit (OBC)?",
    answer: "Onboard credit is ship money you can use during your cruise—like having a prepaid gift card. You can spend it on drinks, specialty dining, Wi-Fi, spa treatments, excursions, or even onboard shopping."
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    question: "How does Zipsea give me more onboard credit than others?",
    answer: "Travel agents earn commission from every booking. Most keep it. We don't. We pass back the maximum onboard credit allowed by the cruise lines every single time."
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    question: "Is this too good to be true?",
    answer: "Nope. Cruise lines set caps on how much OBC can be given. We simply give you that maximum—while other agents usually pocket it as extra commission."
  },
  {
    id: 4,
    question: "How much onboard credit will I actually get?",
    answer: "It depends on your cruise fare and the cruise line's rules. As a ballpark: shorter cruises usually allow $50–$100, longer cruises $150–$500+. When you search a cruise, we'll show you exactly how much."
  },
  {
    id: 5,
    question: "Does onboard credit expire?",
    answer: "Yes, it's only valid for the duration of your sailing. Use it onboard for drinks, dining, spa, excursions, or shopping. It disappears when your cruise ends."
  },
  {
    id: 6,
    question: "What if I cancel my cruise?",
    answer: "Your onboard credit is tied to your booking. If you cancel, the OBC is canceled too. Refunds follow the cruise line's cancellation policy."
  },
  {
    id: 7,
    question: "Can I combine Zipsea's onboard credit with cruise line promotions?",
    answer: "Yes. Our OBC stacks with cruise line sales, loyalty perks, or group offers. The only limit is the cruise line's cap."
  },
  {
    id: 8,
    question: "Do I pay more to book with Zipsea?",
    answer: "No. You pay the same published fare you'd see on the cruise line's website—except we give you back the max OBC."
  },
  {
    id: 9,
    question: "How do I use my onboard credit once onboard?",
    answer: "It's automatically applied to your onboard account. You'll see it on your ship card or app as a credit balance. Just swipe and it deducts."
  },
  {
    id: 10,
    question: "Who is Zipsea? Are you real travel agents?",
    answer: "Yes! We're licensed, accredited travel agents. We just run things lean and tech-driven so we can give you back more of the commission."
  },
  {
    id: 11,
    question: "Can I book online, or do I need to call?",
    answer: "Right now you can search and request a quote online, then we finalize the booking for you. Soon, you'll be able to book directly through our site."
  },
  {
    id: 12,
    question: "What kinds of cruises can I book with Zipsea?",
    answer: "We support all the major ocean cruise lines—and we're expanding to river and expedition cruises soon."
  },
  {
    id: 13,
    question: "What happens after I book?",
    answer: "You'll get a confirmation from both the cruise line and from us. Your onboard credit will appear on your account when you board."
  },
  {
    id: 14,
    question: "Is my money safe if I book through Zipsea?",
    answer: "Absolutely. All payments go directly to the cruise line. We never hold your funds—we just facilitate the booking and perks."
  },
  {
    id: 15,
    question: "Why should I book with Zipsea instead of directly with the cruise line?",
    answer: "Because you'll get the same cabin, same price, same cruise—but more money to spend onboard. It's that simple."
