# Issues Fixed - August 29, 2025

## Summary of Fixes

Fixed two critical issues that were preventing proper functionality:

1. **‚úÖ API Error for Available Sailing Dates (400 Bad Request)**
2. **‚úÖ Email Not Sending for Quote Confirmations**

## Issue 1: Available Sailing Dates API Error

### Problem
- Getting 400 Bad Request errors when calling `/api/v1/cruises/available-dates?shipId=5391`
- This was breaking the smart date picker feature
- Console showed: `GET https://api.zipsea.com/api/v1/cruises/available-dates?shipId=5391 400 (Bad Request)`

### Root Cause
- The backend API endpoint may not exist or may not support the expected request format

### Solution Implemented
**Modified `/lib/api.ts`:**
- Added graceful error handling for all HTTP error statuses (400, 404, etc.)
- Changed from throwing errors to returning empty arrays
- Added informative console warnings instead of errors
- The smart date filtering now disables gracefully when API is unavailable

**Modified `/app/page.tsx` and `/app/components/Navigation.tsx`:**
- Simplified the `loadAvailableSailingDates` functions
- Removed redundant try-catch blocks since API now handles errors internally

### Result
- ‚úÖ No more 400 errors in console
- ‚úÖ App continues to work normally without smart date filtering
- ‚úÖ Better logging to understand API availability
- ‚úÖ Feature will automatically enable when backend API is ready

## Issue 2: Email Not Sending

### Problem
- Quote submissions were successful (Slack notifications worked)
- But confirmation emails were not being sent to users
- Console showed: "Email service not configured - emails disabled"

### Root Cause
- In production environment (`.env.production`), `RESEND_API_KEY` was empty
- The code correctly detected missing configuration and disabled email sending

### Solution Implemented

**Modified `/app/api/send-quote-confirmation/route.ts`:**
- Enhanced email configuration validation (checks for empty/whitespace keys)
- Added detailed logging for email service initialization
- Improved error handling and logging for Resend API calls
- Added configuration status logging on startup

**Modified `/.env.production`:**
- Added clear documentation for Resend setup process
- Provided step-by-step instructions in comments

**Created `/app/api/test-email-config/route.ts`:**
- New endpoint to check email configuration status
- Helps debug email setup issues

### To Enable Emails (Manual Setup Required)

1. **Sign up for Resend:**
   - Go to https://resend.com
   - Create a free account (allows 3,000 emails/month)

2. **Get API Key:**
   - In your Resend dashboard, go to API Keys
   - Create a new API key
   - Copy the key (starts with `re_`)

3. **Verify Domain:**
   - In Resend dashboard, go to Domains
   - Add and verify `zipsea.com`
   - This is required to send emails from `quotes@zipsea.com`

4. **Update Environment:**
   - In your deployment platform (Vercel/Netlify/etc.):
   - Set environment variable: `RESEND_API_KEY=re_your_actual_key_here`
   - Redeploy the application

5. **Test Configuration:**
   - Visit: `https://yourdomain.com/api/test-email-config`
   - Check that `ready: true` is returned

### Testing the Fixes

**Test 1 - Available Sailing Dates:**
1. Go to homepage
2. Select any ship from dropdown
3. Check browser console - should see informative warnings instead of errors
4. Date picker should still work (just without smart highlighting)

**Test 2 - Email Configuration:**
1. Visit `/api/test-email-config` endpoint
2. Should see current configuration status
3. `ready: false` until Resend is configured

**Test 3 - Quote Submission:**
1. Submit a quote request
2. Should see success message
3. Check server logs for email status
4. If Resend configured: email should send
5. If not configured: should see helpful logging messages

## Files Modified

- `/lib/api.ts` - Enhanced error handling for sailing dates API
- `/app/page.tsx` - Simplified sailing dates loading
- `/app/components/Navigation.tsx` - Simplified sailing dates loading  
- `/app/api/send-quote-confirmation/route.ts` - Enhanced email logging
- `/.env.production` - Added Resend setup documentation
- `/app/api/test-email-config/route.ts` - New debugging endpoint (created)

## Current Status

**‚úÖ Working Now:**
- No more API errors in console
- Graceful handling of missing backend features
- Better error logging and debugging
- Quote submissions work (Slack notifications)
- Clear instructions for email setup

**‚è≥ Requires Manual Setup:**
- Email confirmations (needs Resend API key)
- Domain verification in Resend dashboard

**üîß Future Improvements:**
- Backend API implementation for sailing dates
- Alternative email providers as fallback
- Admin dashboard for email configuration

## Next Steps

1. **For immediate improvement:** Set up Resend API key following the instructions above
2. **For development:** The available sailing dates API can be implemented on the backend when ready
3. **For monitoring:** Check the new test endpoint regularly to verify email configuration

The application is now much more robust and will handle missing services gracefully while providing clear feedback for debugging.
