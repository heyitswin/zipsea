# Modal Behavior Fixes & Slack Integration

## Overview
This document describes the fixes implemented for modal behavior issues and the new Slack webhook integration for quote requests.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Modal Behavior Problems

**Problems:**
- When clicking "Get Final Quotes", the modal would close but the sign up modal wouldn't open properly
- When clicking "Get Quote" again, both modals could open simultaneously (double modal issue)
- Race conditions in modal state management

**Solutions Applied:**
- Added `setTimeout` delays to ensure proper modal closing before opening new modals
- Updated `QuoteModal.tsx` to use a 100ms delay when switching from quote modal to login modal
- Added a 200ms delay in the login success callback to prevent race conditions
- Ensured proper state cleanup between modal transitions

**Files Modified:**
- `/app/components/QuoteModal.tsx`

### 2. Expected Behavior Now Working:
- ✅ Clicking "Get Quote" opens only the passenger/quote modal
- ✅ Clicking "Get Final Quotes" closes the quote modal and opens the signup modal (if user is not signed in)
- ✅ No double modal opening occurs
- ✅ Smooth transitions between modals with proper state management

## New Feature: Slack Webhook Integration

### Overview
Added comprehensive Slack webhook integration that sends all quote request details to a designated Slack channel with rich formatting.

### Implementation Details

#### 1. Slack Utility Library
**File:** `/lib/slack.ts`

Features:
- Formatted Slack messages with blocks and sections
- Rich cruise details display
- Passenger information formatting
- Discount qualifiers listing
- Error handling and fallback behavior
- Automatic price and date formatting

#### 2. API Integration
**File:** `/app/api/send-quote-confirmation/route.ts`

The existing quote confirmation API has been enhanced to:
- Send Slack notifications alongside email confirmations
- Handle Slack webhook failures gracefully (doesn't break email flow)
- Log Slack notification results for debugging

#### 3. Slack Message Format

The Slack message includes:
- 📧 Customer email address
- 👥 Passenger counts (adults/children)
- 🚢 Cruise details (name, line, ship, dates, duration)
- 🛏️ Cabin type and pricing
- ✈️ Travel insurance interest
- 🏷️ Discount qualifiers
- ⏰ Submission timestamp
- 🆔 Cruise ID for reference

### Configuration

#### Environment Variables
Add to your `.env.local`:
```bash
# Slack Webhook Integration
SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL=your_slack_webhook_url_here
```

#### Getting a Slack Webhook URL
1. Go to your Slack workspace
2. Navigate to Apps > Incoming Webhooks
3. Create a new webhook for your desired channel
4. Copy the webhook URL
5. Add it to your environment variables

**Note:** If the Slack webhook URL is not configured or set to the placeholder value, the integration will be skipped gracefully without affecting the quote submission process.

### Error Handling
- Slack integration failures do not prevent quote submissions
- All errors are logged for debugging
- The system continues to send confirmation emails even if Slack fails
- Graceful fallback when webhook URL is not configured

## Testing the Fixes

### Modal Behavior Testing
1. Navigate to a cruise detail page
2. Click "Get quote" on any cabin type
3. Verify only the quote modal opens
4. Fill out the form and click "Get final quotes"
5. Verify the quote modal closes and login modal opens (if not signed in)
6. Complete the login process
7. Verify the system properly processes the quote without double modals

### Slack Integration Testing
1. Configure your Slack webhook URL in `.env.local`
2. Submit a quote request through the frontend
3. Check your Slack channel for the formatted message
4. Verify all cruise details, passenger info, and discounts are displayed correctly

## Files Modified

### Core Changes
- `/app/components/QuoteModal.tsx` - Fixed modal behavior with setTimeout delays
- `/app/api/send-quote-confirmation/route.ts` - Added Slack integration
- `/lib/slack.ts` - New Slack utility library

### Configuration
- `/.env.local` - Added SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL
- `/.env.example` - Updated with new environment variables

## Benefits

1. **Improved User Experience:** Smooth modal transitions without conflicts
2. **Real-time Notifications:** Immediate Slack alerts for new quote requests
3. **Rich Information:** Comprehensive quote details formatted for easy reading
4. **Robust Error Handling:** System continues working even if Slack fails
5. **Easy Configuration:** Simple environment variable setup

## Troubleshooting

### Modal Issues
- If modals still conflict, check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Ensure no custom CSS is interfering with z-index values
- Clear browser cache after updates

### Slack Integration
- Verify webhook URL is correctly formatted
- Check Slack workspace permissions
- Monitor console logs for Slack-related errors
- Test with a simple webhook first to verify connectivity

## Security Considerations

- Slack webhook URLs are kept in environment variables (not in code)
- No sensitive customer data is exposed beyond what's necessary for support
- Email addresses are the only personally identifiable information sent to Slack
- All webhook communications use HTTPS

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future iterations:
- Slack threading for follow-up communications
- Integration with Slack workflow automation
- Custom Slack app with interactive buttons
- Quote status updates via Slack
- Multiple webhook URLs for different notification types
