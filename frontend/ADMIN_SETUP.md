- `/api/v1/admin/analytics/users`
- `/api/v1/admin/analytics/revenue`

## Security

- Only users with `role: "admin"` in their Clerk public metadata can access
- Non-admin users are redirected to the homepage
- All admin actions are logged for audit purposes

## Troubleshooting

- Check that the user is properly signed in
- Clear browser cache and refresh

### 403 Unauthorized Error

- Check that Clerk is properly initialized
- Verify middleware is correctly configured

### Data not loading
