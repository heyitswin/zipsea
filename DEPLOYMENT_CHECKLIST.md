## Staging Deployment

### Backend Deployment
- [ ] Deploy backend service to staging environment
- [ ] Verify all environment variables are set correctly
- [ ] Test database connectivity
- [ ] Validate API endpoints respond correctly
- [ ] Check server logs for errors

### Frontend Deployment
- [ ] Build and deploy frontend to staging
- [ ] Verify static assets load correctly
- [ ] Test all page routes (homepage, FAQs, Why Zipsea, cruise details)
- [ ] Validate responsive design on mobile devices
- [ ] Test search functionality end-to-end

### Integration Testing
- [ ] Test complete user flows:
  - [ ] Homepage search → results → cruise detail
  - [ ] Navigation to FAQs and Why Zipsea pages
  - [ ] Footer links and social media icons
  - [ ] Error handling and alert system
- [ ] Performance testing:
  - [ ] Page load times acceptable
  - [ ] Search response times under 3 seconds
  - [ ] Image loading performance
- [ ] Cross-browser testing (Chrome, Safari, Firefox)

## Production Deployment

### Final Checks
- [ ] All staging tests passed successfully
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met
- [ ] Security scan completed
- [ ] Backup procedures verified
- [ ] Rollback plan prepared

### Deployment Steps
1. [ ] Database backup
2. [ ] Deploy backend service
3. [ ] Run database migrations (if any)
4. [ ] Deploy frontend build
5. [ ] Update CDN cache (if applicable)
6. [ ] Verify all services are running
7. [ ] Test critical user flows

### Post-Deployment Monitoring
- [ ] Monitor server logs for errors
- [ ] Check application performance metrics
- [ ] Validate user analytics are tracking
- [ ] Test from multiple geographic locations
- [ ] Monitor for any reported issues

## Key Files for Deployment

### Backend Files
- `backend/src/services/search.service.ts` - Fixed PostgreSQL queries
- `backend/src/controllers/cruise.controller.ts` - API endpoints
- `backend/src/routes/` - All route definitions
- `backend/.env` - Environment configuration

### Frontend Files
- `frontend/app/` - All page components and routing
- `frontend/public/` - Static assets (images, icons)
- `frontend/components/` - Global alert system
- `frontend/package.json` - Dependencies (updated for production)
- `frontend/.env.local` - API configuration

### Configuration Files
- `render.yaml` - Deployment configuration
- `frontend/next.config.ts` - Next.js configuration
- `.gitignore` - Updated for proper asset inclusion

## Known Issues to Monitor

### High Priority
1. **FTP Sync Performance**: Monitor sync script for rate limiting issues
2. **Database Connection Pool**: Watch for connection exhaustion during large operations
3. **Image Loading**: Monitor for slow loading images (consider CDN implementation)

### Medium Priority
1. **Search Performance**: Monitor response times, consider implementing caching
2. **Mobile Performance**: Watch for any mobile-specific issues
3. **Error Rates**: Monitor application error rates and user feedback

## Emergency Procedures

### Rollback Process
1. Revert to previous backend deployment
2. Revert frontend to last known good build
3. Restore database from backup if necessary
4. Update DNS/CDN to point to previous version

### Contact Information
- **Primary Developer**: Available during deployment window
- **Database Admin**: Contact for database issues
- **Infrastructure Team**: Contact for server/networking issues

## Success Criteria

### Performance Metrics
- Page load time < 3 seconds
- Search response time < 2 seconds
- 99.9% uptime during first 24 hours
- Zero critical errors in logs

### Functional Requirements
- All navigation links working
- Search functionality operational
- Cruise detail pages displaying correctly
- FAQs and Why Zipsea pages accessible
- Mobile responsiveness maintained
- Error handling working as expected

## Post-Deployment Tasks

### Immediate (0-24 hours)
- [ ] Monitor application performance
- [ ] Check error logs every 4 hours
- [ ] Validate user flows are working
- [ ] Monitor database performance

### Short-term (1-7 days)
- [ ] Analyze user behavior and page views
- [ ] Monitor performance metrics
- [ ] Gather user feedback
- [ ] Address any reported issues

### Long-term (1+ weeks)
- [ ] Performance optimization based on real usage
- [ ] Plan next feature implementations
- [ ] Review and update deployment procedures
- [ ] Implement monitoring improvements
