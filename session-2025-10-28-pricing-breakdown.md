# Session: October 28, 2025 - Pricing Breakdown Implementation

## Context
Continued from previous session that ran out of context. Previous work had implemented an `initializePricing` endpoint that created a temporary hold booking with dummy data to force Traveltek to populate the pricing breakdown array.

## Problem Identified
The `initializePricing` approach was overly complex:
- Created TWO separate bookings in Traveltek's system
- Dummy data was never replaced
- Violated requirement: "as long as all the dummy data is replaced eventually"

## Solution: cruisecabingradebreakdown.pl API
Discovered Traveltek has a dedicated endpoint for pricing breakdown:
- **Endpoint**: `/cruisecabingradebreakdown.pl`
- **Works in search mode**: Can be called BEFORE basket (no itemkey needed)
- **Works in basket mode**: Can be called AFTER basket (with itemkey)
- **Returns**: Itemized costs (cruise fare, taxes, fees, discounts, etc.)

## Implementation
1. Added `getCabinGradeBreakdown()` method to API service
2. Call it automatically after `addToBasket()` in `selectCabin()`  
3. Store breakdown in session (`pricingBreakdown` field)
4. Removed all `initializePricing` code (controller, route, frontend call)

## Files Modified
- `backend/src/services/traveltek-api.service.ts` - Added getCabinGradeBreakdown
- `backend/src/services/traveltek-booking.service.ts` - Call breakdown after basket
- `backend/src/services/traveltek-session.service.ts` - Add pricingBreakdown field
- `backend/src/controllers/booking.controller.ts` - Removed initializePricing
- `backend/src/routes/booking.routes.ts` - Removed initialize-pricing route
- `frontend/app/booking/[sessionId]/options/page.tsx` - Removed useEffect call

## Commits
- 5d0d18b - Fix database check instead of non-existent field
- 17ec587 - Add pricing breakdown from cruisecabingradebreakdown.pl
- 8a0ce95/7a4e5dd - Remove initializePricing code

## Testing Needed
1. Reserve a cabin on staging
2. Check options page for pricing breakdown display
3. Verify breakdown array structure matches PricingSummary component expectations
4. Test across multiple cruises/cabin types

## Next Steps
- If breakdown doesn't display, check logs for API response structure
- May need to update PricingSummary component to parse new format
- Consider adding breakdown to getBasket as fallback
