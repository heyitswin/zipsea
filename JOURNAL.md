## 2025-01-29 - OBC Calculation Fix & Comprehensive UI/UX Improvements

### Summary
Fixed critical onboard credit (OBC) calculation mismatch between cruise detail page and pricing summary, and implemented 14 UI/UX improvements to enhance booking flow and user experience.

### Issues Resolved

#### 1. OBC Calculation Mismatch ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL
**Problem**: The cruise detail page was calculating OBC as 8% of commissionable fare, while the pricing summary calculated it as 10%. This caused inconsistent OBC amounts shown to users during the booking process.

**Root Cause**: Two different percentage values hardcoded in different parts of the application:
- `frontend/app/cruise/[slug]/CruiseDetailClient.tsx`: Used `0.08` (8%)
- `frontend/app/components/PricingSummary.tsx`: Used `0.1` (10%)

**Solution**: Updated cruise detail page to use 10% consistently:
- Changed `const creditPercent = 0.08` to `0.1` in two locations
- Verified OBC calculation formula: `Math.floor((cruiseFare * 0.1) / 10) * 10`
- Formula rounds down to nearest $10

**Impact**: Users now see consistent OBC amounts throughout the booking flow, preventing confusion and maintaining trust.

### UI/UX Improvements Implemented

#### 2. OBC Display Design Update
**Change**: Updated onboard credit display styling for better visual hierarchy
- Background: Changed from dark green `#1B8F57` to light green `#D4F4DD`
- Text color: Changed from white to dark green `#1B8F57`
- Layout: Title now appears on its own line above the OBC amount
- File: `frontend/app/components/PricingSummary.tsx`

**Benefit**: Improved readability and visual separation of OBC information from other pricing details.

#### 3. Removed Perk Selection from Booking Flow
**Change**: Completely removed the "Choose Your Free Perk" section from step 3 (payment page)
- Removed 3 perk options: WiFi, Drink Package, and Specialty Dining
- Cleaned up unused state variables
- File: `frontend/app/booking/[sessionId]/payment/page.tsx`

**Reasoning**: Simplified checkout flow by removing feature that was not yet operational.

#### 4. Instant Booking Filter ‚≠ê NEW FEATURE
**Implementation**: Added "Instant Booking Only" filter to cruise search
- Desktop: Added checkbox in left sidebar under "Booking Options"
- Mobile: Added checkbox in filter modal
- Backend integration: Sends `instantBooking=true` parameter to API
- Filters by `TRAVELTEK_LIVE_BOOKING_LINE_IDS` (Royal Caribbean #22, Celebrity #3)
- File: `frontend/app/cruises/CruisesContent.tsx`

**Business Value**: Allows users to quickly find cruises with immediate booking capability, improving conversion rates.

#### 5-7. Enhanced Cabin Type Button UX üéØ MAJOR IMPROVEMENT
**Changes**:
1. **Always show all 4 cabin types** (Interior, Oceanview, Balcony, Suite)
   - Previously: Hidden if no availability
   - Now: Always visible but disabled when unavailable

2. **Disabled button styling**:
   - Gray background `#F3F4F6`
   - Gray text `#9CA3AF`
   - Gray border `#E5E7EB`
   - Non-clickable cursor

3. **"No cabins available" caption**: Displays under disabled buttons

4. **"Starting from $X" caption**: Shows lowest price under available buttons
   - Calculates minimum price from available cabins
   - Rounds to nearest dollar
   - Bold dark blue text

5. **Auto-selection logic**: Automatically selects first available cabin type
   - Triggers when selected type has no cabins
   - Checks in order: Interior ‚Üí Oceanview ‚Üí Balcony ‚Üí Suite
   - Includes console logging for debugging

**Technical Implementation**:
- Refactored category tabs using array mapping
- Added `hasAvailability` check per category
- Added `lowestPrice` calculation
- Added `useEffect` hook for auto-selection
- File: `frontend/app/cruise/[slug]/CruiseDetailClient.tsx`

**User Experience Impact**: 
- Users understand what cabin types exist even when unavailable
- Clear pricing visibility helps decision-making
- Automatic fallback prevents "empty state" confusion

#### 8. Top Destinations Auto-Filter
**Change**: All destination cards now automatically enable Live Booking filter
- Added `?instantBooking=true` to all destination links
- Applies to both main cards and quick links
- File: `frontend/app/top-destinations/page.tsx`

**Benefit**: Users exploring destinations see only instantly bookable cruises, streamlining the booking journey.

#### 9. Updated Bahamas Card Text
**Change**: Updated tagline from "Weekend getaways" to "2-5 day trips"
- More accurate description of cruise duration
- File: `frontend/app/page.tsx`

#### 10. Caribbean Filter Update
**Change**: Updated night range filter from exact 7 nights to 6-8 night range
- Before: `minNights=7&maxNights=7`
- After: `nights=6-8`
- File: `frontend/app/page.tsx`

**Reasoning**: Provides more flexibility and matches typical Caribbean cruise durations.

#### 11. New York Cruises Link Fix
**Change**: Updated departure port parameter
- Changed from `departurePorts` to `ports`
- Updated port IDs: `5171,5170,207,362` (added port 207)
- File: `frontend/app/page.tsx`

#### 12. Mobile Homepage Performance Optimization üì± PERFORMANCE
**Implementation**: Show static thumbnail instead of video on mobile
- Desktop (md+): Loads and plays video
- Mobile (<md): Shows static image `/images/updated-homepage/homepage-video-thumbnail.jpg`
- Video not loaded in DOM on mobile
- Both use same SVG mask for consistency
- File: `frontend/app/page.tsx`

**Performance Impact**:
- Reduces mobile data usage significantly
- Faster page load on mobile devices
- Maintains visual consistency with desktop

**Technical Notes**:
- Uses Tailwind `hidden md:block` for video
- Uses `md:hidden` for image
- Image uses Next.js `Image` component with `priority` flag
- Same mask styling applied to both elements

#### 13. Passenger Age Requirement Update
**Change**: Updated adult age from "18+" to "12+"
- File: `frontend/app/components/PassengerSelector.tsx`

**Reasoning**: Aligns with cruise industry standard age definitions.

#### 14. Cabin Details in Pricing Summary ‚úÖ VERIFIED
**Status**: Feature already implemented and working correctly
- Displays cabin name, code, room number, and deck number
- Positioned above pricing breakdown
- File: `frontend/app/components/PricingSummary.tsx`

### Royal Caribbean Cancellation Policy
**Status**: ‚úÖ No changes needed
- URL already correct in database
- Link: `https://www.royalcaribbean.com/faq/questions/booking-cancellation-refund-policy`
- File: `backend/scripts/update-cancellation-policies.sql`

### Testing Recommendations

1. **OBC Consistency Check**:
   - Verify OBC amount matches between cruise detail page and pricing summary
   - Test with various cabin types and price points
   - Confirm calculation: 10% of cruise fare, rounded to nearest $10

2. **Cabin Type Buttons**:
   - Test all 4 cabin types with varying availability
   - Verify disabled state shows "No cabins available"
   - Verify available state shows "Starting from $X"
   - Confirm auto-selection works when no cabins in selected type

3. **Instant Booking Filter**:
   - Toggle filter on/off on desktop and mobile
   - Verify only Royal Caribbean and Celebrity cruises show when enabled
   - Test that filter persists in URL parameters

4. **Mobile Performance**:
   - Check homepage loads without video on mobile
   - Verify thumbnail image displays correctly
   - Confirm desktop still shows video

5. **Destination Filters**:
   - Click Bahamas card ‚Üí should show 2-5 night cruises
   - Click Caribbean card ‚Üí should show 6-8 night cruises
   - Click New York card ‚Üí should use correct port IDs

### Business Impact

**Conversion Rate Improvements**:
- Consistent OBC amounts build trust and reduce cart abandonment
- Instant booking filter helps users find immediately bookable cruises
- Clear cabin availability prevents confusion and dead-ends
- Pricing transparency with "Starting from $X" aids decision-making

**Performance Gains**:

### Technical Debt Notes

**Image Asset Required**:
- Need to create/add: `/images/updated-homepage/homepage-video-thumbnail.jpg`
- Should be a representative frame from the homepage video
- Recommended resolution: Match video frame size
- Ensure proper aspect ratio for mask application

**Future Improvements**:
1. Consider A/B testing OBC percentage (8% vs 10%) to optimize for conversions
2. Add analytics tracking to Instant Booking filter usage
3. Monitor cabin auto-selection behavior for potential improvements
4. Consider lazy-loading video on desktop for further performance gains

### Developer Notes

**OBC Calculation Formula**:
```typescript
// 10% of commissionable fare (cruise fare), rounded down to nearest $10
const creditPercent = 0.1;
const rawCredit = cruiseFare * creditPercent;
const obcAmount = Math.floor(rawCredit / 10) * 10;
```

**Cabin Category Mapping**:
```typescript
API Category ‚Üí Display Name
inside       ‚Üí interior
outside      ‚Üí oceanview
balcony      ‚Üí balcony
suite        ‚Üí suite
```

**Live Booking Line IDs**:
- Royal Caribbean: `22`
- Celebrity: `3`
- Defined in: `backend/src/config/environment.ts`
- Default: `TRAVELTEK_LIVE_BOOKING_LINE_IDS='22,3'`
